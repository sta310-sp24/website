The data were originally obtained from the Yelp Dataset Challenge on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/yelp-dataset/yelp-dataset), which contains about 60,000 reviews on 888 restaurants posted by over 20,000 reviewers.\n\nWe will focus on the following variables:\n\n-   `stars_given`: Restaurant star rating 1(worst) - 5(best)\n-   `length100`: Number words in the review / 100\n-   `useful`: Number of users who rated the review as \"useful\"\n-   `funny`: Number of users who rated the review was \"funny\"\n-   `cool`: Number of users who rated the review as \"cool\"\n-   `revs_user100`: Number of previous reviews the user has written / 100\n-   `revs_biz100`: Number of reviews the restaurant has / 100\n-   `avg_biz_stars`: Average star rating for restaurant\n-   `user_id`: Denotes the reviewer\n-   `name`: Name of restaurant being reviewed\n\n**The goal of the analysis is to determine what factors are associated with a good Yelp review.**\n\n## Exploratory data analysis\n\n## Exercise 1\n\nConsider the distribution of the response variable `stars_given`.\n\n-   What type of model(s) can we fit to understand the association between the a good Yelp review and the other factors?\n\n-   What random effect(s) do we need to account for in the model(s)?\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n## add code here\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Exercise 2\n\nVisualize the relationship between the response and 1 - 2 predictors. What do you observe from these plots?\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n## add code here\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Modeling\n\n## Exercise 3\n\nFit and display the model(s) described in Exercise 1.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# add code here\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Conclusions\n\n## Exercise 4\n\nWe will use one of the models from Exercise 3 to draw conclusions about factors associated with a good Yelp review. Which model do choose? Briefly explain your choice.\n\n## Exercise 5\n\nUse the model selected from the previous exercise. What factors are associated with a good Yelp review?\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nThe data set used in this exercise was obtained from the [collection of data sets](https://github.com/proback/BeyondMLR/tree/master/data) in [*Beyond Multiple Linear Regression*](https://bookdown.org/roback/bookdown-BeyondMLR/).\n",
