Click on the repo with the prefix **lab-02-**. It contains the starter documents you need to complete the lab.\n\n-   Clone the repo and start a new project in RStudio. See the [Lab 01 instructions](lab-01.qmd) for details on cloning a repo, starting a new project in R, and configuring git.\n\n# Packages\n\nThe following packages are used in the lab:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(tidymodels)\nlibrary(knitr)\nlibrary(lterdatasampler) \n```\n:::\n\n\n# Data: Ice cover and air temperature\n\nThe datasets [`ntl_icecover`](https://lter.github.io/lterdatasampler/reference/ntl_icecover.html) and [`ntl_airtemp`](https://lter.github.io/lterdatasampler/reference/ntl_airtemp.html) [lterdatasampler](https://lter.github.io/lterdatasampler/index.html) R package[^1] contain information about ice cover and air temperature, respectively, at Lake Monona and Lake Mendota for days in 1885 through 2019. The data were originally collected at a [US Long Term Ecological Research program (LTER) Network](https://lternet.edu/).\n\n[^1]: https://lter.github.io/lterdatasampler/index.html\n\nThe primary variables for this analysis are\n\n-   `year`: a number denoting the year of observation\n\n-   `lakeid`: a factor denoting the lake name\n\n-   `ice_duration`: a number denoting the number of days between the freeze and breakup dates of each lake\n\n-   `ave_air_temp_adjusted`: a number denoting the air temperature in degrees Celsius, collected in Madison, WI and adjusted for biases\n\n# Exercises\n\n**Goal**: The goal of this analysis is to use linear regression understand the association between average air temperature and ice duration for two lakes in Madison, Wisconsin that freeze for a portion of the year. Because ice cover is impacted by various environmental factors, researchers are interested in examining the association between these two factors to better understand how changing air temperature is impacting the ice duration.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWrite all code and narrative in your Quarto file. Write all narrative in complete sentences. Throughout the assignment, you should periodically **render** your Quarto document to produce the updated PDF, **commit** the changes in the Git pane, and **push** the updated files to GitHub.\n\n::: callout-tip\nMake sure we can read all of your code in your PDF document. This means you will need to break up long lines of code. One way to help avoid long lines of code is is start a new line after every pipe (`|>`) and plus sign (`+`).\n:::\n\n### Exercise 1\n\nFill in the code below to create a new data frame, `icecover_avg`, of the average ice duration by lake then year. How many observations (rows) are in `icecover_avg`? How many variables (columns)?\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nicecover_avg <- ntl_icecover |>\n  group_by(____, _____) |>\n  summarise(avg_ice_duration = mean(_____), .groups = \"drop\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n### Exercise 2\n\n-   Use `ntl_airtemp` to create a new data frame `airtemp_avg` of the average air temperature by year.\n\n-   Then, join `icecover_avg` and `airtemp_avg` to make a new data frame `ice_air_joined`. Remove the years that have missing data for the average annual air temperature or the average annual ice duration.\n\n::: callout-important\nYou will use `ice_air_joined` for exercises 3 - 7.\n:::\n\n### Exercise 3\n\nMake a histogram to visualize the distribution of `avg_ice_duration` and calculate summary statistics for the center and spread of the distribution. Include informative axis labels and an informative title on the visualization.\n\nUse the visualization and summary statistics to describe the distribution of `avg_ice_duration` . Include the shape, center, spread, and potential presence of outliers in the description.\n\n### Exercise 4\n\nMake a histogram of the distribution of `avg_air_temp`. Then make another visualization of the distribution of `avg_air_temp` using a different type of plot. Include informative axis labels and an informative title on both visualizations.\n\nWhat type of plot did you make? What is one feature of the distribution that is more apparent in the histogram than in the other plot? What is one feature of the distribution that is more apparent in the other plot than in the histogram?\n\n::: render-commit-push\nThis is a good place to render, commit, and push changes to your remote lab repo on GitHub. Click the checkbox next to each file in the Git pane to stage the updates you've made, write an informative commit message, and push. After you push the changes, the Git pane in RStudio should be empty.\n:::\n\n### Exercise 5\n\nMake a visualization of `avg_ice_duration` versus `year` with the points colored by `lakeid`. Write two observations from the visualization.\n\n### Exercise 6\n\nCreate a visualization of `avg_air_temp` versus `year`. Include informative axis labels and an informative title on the visualization.\n\n-   Use the visualization to write two observations about the trend of average air temperature over time.\n\n-   Based on the visualizations of average ice duration and average air temperature over time, would you expect the linear model describing the association between average ice duration and average air temperature to have a positive or negative slope? Briefly explain.\n\n### Exercise 7\n\nResearchers would like to use a linear model to understand variability in the average ice duration based on the average air temperature. **Their analysis will focus only on Lake Monona.** Write the form of the statistical model the researchers would like to estimate. Use mathematical notation and variable names (`avg_air_temp` and `avg_ice_duration`) in the equation.\n\n::: callout-tip\n[Click here](https://oeis.org/wiki/List_of_LaTeX_mathematical_symbols) for a guide on writing mathematical symbols using LaTex. You will need to use a backslash (\\\\) before each underscore in the LaTex code. For example, `avg_air_temp` will be written as *avg\\\\\\_air\\\\\\_temp.*\n:::\n\n::: render-commit-push\nThis is a good place to render, commit, and push changes to your remote lab repo on GitHub.

After you push the changes, the Git pane in RStudio should be empty.\n:::\n\n### Exercise 8\n\nFit and display the output of the regression model corresponding to the statistical model in the previous exercise. **As in the previous exercise, only observations from Lake Monona should be included in the analysis.** Use the `tidy` and `kable` functions to neatly display the model output using three decimal places.\n\n-   Write the equation of the fitted model. Use mathematical notation and variable names (`avg_air_temp` and `avg_ice_duration`) in the equation.\n\n-   Interpret the slope in the context of the data.\n\n-   Does the intercept have a meaningful interpretation in this context? If so, interpret the intercept in the context of the data. Otherwise, explain why not.\n\n### Exercise 9\n\nUse bootstrapping to construct a 93% confidence interval for the slope for Lake Monona. Follow these steps to accomplish this:\n\n-   First, set a seed for simulating reproducibly. Use the seed `210`.\n-   Save the value of slope estimated from the data.\n-   Then, simulate the bootstrap distribution of the slope using 1,000 bootstrap samples.\n-   Visualize the bootstrap distribution.\n-   Calculate the bounds of the confidence interval using the percentile method.\n-   Interpret the confidence interval in the context of the data.\n\n## Exercise 10\n\n> There is a statistically significant linear relationship between average air temperature and average ice duration on Lake Monona $(\\beta_1 \\neq 0)$.\n\nDoes the confidence interval you calculated in the previous exercise support or refute this claim?
