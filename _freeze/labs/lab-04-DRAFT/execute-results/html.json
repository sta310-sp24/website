This will be your team for labs and the final project. Before you get started on the lab, complete the following:\n\n✅ Come up with a team name. You can\\'t use the same name as another team, so I encourage you to be creative! Your TA will get your team name by the end of lab.\n\n✅ Fill out the team agreement. This will help you figure out a plan for communication,and working together during labs and outside of lab times. You can find the team agreement in the GitHub repo **team-agreement-\\[github_team_name\\]**.\n\n-   Have **one person** from the team clone the repo and start a new RStudio project. This person will type the team\\'s responses as you discuss the sections of the agreement. No one else in the team should type at this point but should be contributing to the discussion.\n\n-   Be sure to push the completed agreement to GitHub. Each team member can refer to the document in this repo or download the PDF of the agreement for future reference. *You do [not]{.underline} need to submit the agreement on Gradescope.*\n\n## Getting started\n\n-   A repository has already been created for you and your teammates. Everyone in your team has access to the same repo.\n-   Go to the [sta210-fa22](https://www.github.com/sta210-fa22) organization on GitHub. Click on the repo with the prefix **lab-04**. It contains the starter documents you need to complete the lab.\n-   Each person on the team should clone the repository and open a new project in RStudio. Throughout the lab, each person should get a chance to make commits and push to the repo.\n-   **Do not make any changes to the `.qmd` file until the instructions tell you do to so.**\n\n## Workflow: Using Git and GitHub as a team\n\n::: callout-important\nAssign each person on your team a number 1 through 4. For teams of three, Team Member 1 can take on the role of Team Member 4.\n\nThe following exercises must be done in order. **Only one person should type in the `.qmd` file, commit, and push updates at a time.** When it is not your turn to type, you should still share ideas and contribute to the team's discussion.\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-important appearance=\"simple\"}\n⌨️ **Team Member 1: Hands on the keyboard.**\n\n🙅🏽 All other team members: Hands off the keyboard until otherwise instructed![^1]\n:::\n\n[^1]: Don't trust yourself to keep your hands off the keyboard?

This data set contains the entire script transcriptions from *The Office*.\n\nLet's start by taking a peek at the data.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nglimpse(theoffice)\n```\n:::\n\n\nThere are 55130 observations and 12 columns in this data set. The variable names are as follows.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nnames(theoffice)\n```\n:::\n\n\nEach row in the data set is a line spoken by a character in a given episode of the show. This means some information at the episode level (e.g., `imdb_rating`, `air_date`, etc. are repeated across the rows that belong to a single episode.\n\nThe `air_date` variable is coded as a factor, which is undesirable for the analysis. We'll want to parse that variable later into its components during feature engineering. So, for now, let's convert it to date.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntheoffice <- theoffice |>\n  mutate(air_date = ymd(as.character(air_date)))\n```\n:::\n\n\nLet's take a look at the data to confirm we're happy with how each of the variables are encoded.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nglimpse(theoffice)\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Exercises\n\n### Data prep\n\n::: {.callout-important appearance=\"simple\"}\n⌨️ **Team Member 1: Hands still on the keyboard. Write the answers to Exercises 1 and 2.**\n\n🙅🏽 All other team members: Hands off the keyboard until otherwise instructed!\n:::\n\n#### Exercise 1\n\nIdentify episodes where Halloween, Valentine's Day, and Christmas are mentioned.\n\n-   First, convert all `text` to lowercase with the function `str_to_lower()`.\n-   Then, create three new variables (`halloween_mention`, `valentine_mention`, and `christmas_mention`) that take the value `1` if the character string `\"halloween\"`, `\"valentine\"`, or `\"christmas\"` appears in the text, respectively, and `0` otherwise.\n\nBelow is code to help you get started.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntheoffice <- theoffice |>\n  mutate(\n    text = ___(text),\n    halloween_mention = if_else(str_detect(text, \"___\"), ___, ___),\n    valentine_mention = ___,\n    ___ = ___\n  )\n```\n:::\n\n\n#### Exercise 2\n\nIn this exercise we'll accomplish two separate tasks. We're doing both tasks all at once, because we're going to drastically change our data frame, from one row per line spoken to one row per episode. We'll call the resulting data frame `office_episodes`.\n\nThe two tasks are as follows:\n\n-   **Task 1.** Identify episodes where the word \"halloween\", \"valentine\", or \"christmas\" were ever mentioned, using variables you created in Exercise 1.\n-   **Task 2.** Calculate the percentage of lines spoken by Jim, Pam, Michael, and Dwight for each episode of *The Office*.\n\nBelow are instructions and starter code to get you started with these tasks.\n\n-   Start by grouping `theoffice` data by `season`, `episode`, `episode_name`, `imdb_rating`, `total_votes`, and `air_date`. (These variables, except for `season` have the same value for each given episode, hence grouping by them allows us to make sure they appear in the output of this pipeline.)\n-   Use `summarize()` to calculate the desired features at the season-episode level.\n-   **Task 1:**\n    -   Calculate the number of lines per season per episode. You can might name this new variable `n_lines`.\n    -   Then, calculate the proportion of lines in that episode spoken by each of the four `character`s Jim, Pam, Michael, and Dwight. Name these new variables `lines_jim`, `lines_pam`, `lines_michael`, and `lines_dwight`, respectively.\n-   **Task 2:**\n    -   Create a variable called `halloween` that sums up the `1`s in `halloween_mention` at the season-episode level and takes on the value `\"yes\"` if the sum is greater than or equal to 1, or `\"no\"` otherwise.\n    -   Do something similar for new variables `valentine` and `christmas` as well based on values from `valentine_mention` and `christmas_mention`.\n-   Finish up your `summarize()` statement by dropping the groups, so the resulting data frame is no longer grouped. Additionally, remove `n_lines` (we won't use that variable in our analysis, we only calculated it as an intermediary step).\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\noffice_episodes <- theoffice |>\n  group_by(___) |>\n  summarize(\n    n_lines = n(),\n    lines_jim = sum(character == \"___\") / n_lines,\n    lines_pam = ___,\n    lines_michael = ___,\n    lines_dwight = ___,\n    halloween = if_else(sum(___) >= 1, \"yes\", \"no\"),\n    valentine = if_else(___, \"___\", \"___\"),\n    christmas = if_else(___, \"___\", \"___\"),\n    .groups = \"drop\"\n  ) |>\n  select(-n_lines)\n```\n:::\n\n\n::: callout-note\nWhy `summarize()` and not `mutate()`? We use `mutate()` to add / modify a column of a data frame. The output data frame always has the same number of rows as the input data frame. On the other hand, we use `summarize()` to reduce the data frame to either a single row (single summary statistic) or one row per each group (summary statistics at the group level).\n\nAnd what about that `.groups` argument in summarize? You could try running your `summarize()` step without it first. You'll see that R print out a message saying *\"`summarize()` has grouped output by `season`, `episode`. You can override using the `.groups` argument.\"* `summarize()` will only drop the last group. So if you want a data frame that doesn't have a grouping structure as a result of a `summarize()`, you can explicitly ask for that with `.groups = \"drop\"`. Before you proceed, read the [documentation for `summarize()`](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/summarise.html), and specifically the explanation for the `.groups` argument to prepare yourself for future instances where you might see this type of message.\n:::\n\n::: render-commit-push\n**Team Member 1:** Render the document and confirm that the changes are visible in the PDF.

Add an indicator variable, `michael`, that takes on the value `\"yes\"` if Michael Scott (Steve Carrell) was in the show, and `\"no\"` if not.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\noffice_episodes <- office_episodes |>\n  mutate(michael = if_else(season > ___, \"___\", \"___\"))\n```\n:::\n\n\n#### Exercise 4\n\nPrint out the dimensions (`dim()`) of the new data set you created as well as the `names()` of the columns in the data set.\n\nYour new data set, `office_episodes,` should have 186 rows and 14 columns. The column names should be `season`, `episode`, `episode_name`, `imdb_rating`, `total_votes`, `air_date`, `lines_jim`, `lines_pam`, `lines_michael`, `lines_dwight`, `halloween`, `valentine`, `christmas`, and `michael`. If you are not matching these numbers or columns, go back and try to figure out where you went wrong. Or ask your TA for help!\n\n### Exploratory data analysis\n\nThis would be a good place to conduct some exploratory data analysis (EDA). For example, plot the proportion of lines spoken by each character over time. Or calculate the percentage of episodes that mention Halloween, or Valentine's Day, or Christmas. Given we have limited time in the lab we're not going to ask you to report EDA results as part of this lab, but we're noting this here to provide suggestions for how you might go about structuring your project.\n\n### Modeling prep\n\n#### Exercise 5\n\nSplit the data into training (75%) and testing (25%).
