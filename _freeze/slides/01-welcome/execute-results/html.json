The GLM generalizes linear regression by allowing the linear model to be related to the response variable via a link function and by allowing the magnitude of the variance of each measurement to be a function of its predicted value.*[^1]\n\n[^1]: Souce: [Generalized linear model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_linear_model)\n\n. . .\n\n**Example: Logistic regression**\n\n$$\\begin{aligned}\\pi = P(y = 1 | x) \\hspace{2mm} &\\Rightarrow \\hspace{2mm} \\text{Link function: } \\log\\big(\\frac{\\pi}{1-\\pi}\\big) \\\\\n&\\Rightarrow \\log\\big(\\frac{\\pi}{1-\\pi}\\big) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1~x\\end{aligned}$$\n\n## Course learning objectives {.midi}\n\nBy the end of the semester, you will be able to ...\n\n::: incremental\n-   describe generalized linear models (GLMs) as a unified framework.\n-   explain how specific models fit into the GLM framework, including extensions for correlated data.\n-   identify the appropriate model given the data and analysis objective.\n-   analyze real-world data by fitting and interpreting GLMs.\n-   use R for analysis, Quarto to write reports, git for version control, and GitHub for collaboration.\n-   effectively communicate results from statistical analyses to a general audience in writing and oral presentations.\n:::\n\n## Course topics\n\n**Generalized Linear Models**\n\n-   Introduce models for non-normal response variables\n-   Estimation, interpretation, and inference\n-   Mathematical details of GLMs as a unified framework\n\n. . .\n\n**Modeling correlated data**\n\n-   Introduce multilevel models for correlated and longitudinal data\n\n-   Estimation, interpretation, and inference\n\n-   Mathematical details, particularly diving into covariance structures\n\n## Examples - \\[UPDATE\\]\n\n\\[ Add some examples of GLMs\\]\n\n-   Poisson regression or gamma? - RHD paper?\n\n-   Longitudinal modeling?\n\n-   Sports data\n\n# Meet your classmates!\n\n## Meet your classmates!

If any course component is not accessible to you in any way, please don‚Äôt hesitate to let me know.\n\n## Support {.midi}\n\n-   **Office hours** to meet with a member of the teaching team.\n\n    -   Find the schedule in the syllabus and [course webpage](https://sta310-sp24.netlify.app/course-overview)\n    -   Office hours begin January 16\n    -   Please email me if you'd like to meet before then\n\n-   **Slack** for questions about course logistics, content, and assignments\n\n-   **Email** for questions not appropriate for Slack, e.g., regarding personal matters or grades\n\n    -   Please put **STA 310** in the subject line\n\nSee the [syllabus](https://sta310-sp24.netlify.app/syllabus/#additional-support) and [support](https://sta310-sp24.netlify.app/support) page for additional academic and mental health and wellness resources\n\n# Course policies\n\n## COVID-19 and other illness\n\n-   Please do not come to class if you have tested positive for COVID-19, have possible symptoms and have not yet been tested, or have other illness.\n\n-   Read and follow the university guidelines regarding COVID-19 at [coronavirus.duke.edu](https://coronavirus.duke.edu/).\n\n## Late work {.midi}\n\n-   Homework will be accepted up to 48 hours after the deadline. There will be a 5% deduction for each 24-hour period the assignment is late.\n\n-   No late work is accepted on quizzes, and there are no makeups for missed quizzes.\n\n-   Late policy for projects:\n\n    -   **Presentation:** Late presentations are not accepted and there are no make ups for missed presentations.\n\n    -   **Write up:** There will be a 5% deduction for write ups submitted late but the same day, a 10% deduction for write ups submitted the next day, and a 15% deduction for write ups submitted two days late (by 11:59pm). No credit given for write ups submitted more than 2 days after the deadline.\n\n    -   **Peer evaluation:** No late work is accepted on peer evaluations.\n\n## Academic integrity and collaboration {.midi}\n\n-   The homework assignments must be completed individually and you are welcomed to discuss the assignment with classmates at a high level.\n-   You may not discuss or otherwise work with others on quizzes.\n-   For the projects collaboration within teams is not only allowed, but expected. Communication between teams at a high level is also allowed however you may not share code or components of the project across teams.\n-   **Reusing code**: Unless explicitly stated otherwise, you may make use of online resources (e.g.¬†StackOverflow) for coding examples on assignments. If you directly use code from an outside source (or use it as inspiration), you must explicitly cite where you obtained the code.\n\n## Use of artificial intelligence (AI)\n\n-   You should treat AI tools, such as ChatGPT, the same as other online resources.\n\n-   There are two guiding principles that govern how you can use AI in this course:[^2]\n\n    -   \\(1\\) *Cognitive dimension:* Working with AI should not reduce your ability to think clearly. We will practice using AI to facilitate‚Äîrather than hinder‚Äîlearning.\n\n    -   \\(2\\) *Ethical dimension***:** Students using AI should be transparent about their use and make sure it aligns with academic integrity.\n\n[^2]: These guiding principles are based on [*Course Policies related to ChatGPT and other AI Tools*](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WpCeTyiWCPQ9MNCsFeKMDQLSTsg1oKfNIH6MzoSFXqQ/preview) developed by Joel Gladd, Ph.D.[‚Ü©Ô∏é](https://sta101-f23.github.io/course-syllabus.html#fnref1)\n\n## Use of artificial intelligence (AI)\n\n‚úÖ **AI tools for code:** You may make use of the technology for coding examples on assignments; if you do so, you must explicitly cite where you obtained the code.\n\n‚ùå **No AI tools for narrative:** Unless instructed otherwise, AI is [**not**]{.underline} permitted for writing narrative on assignments.\n\n<br>\n\n::: callout-important\nIn general, you may use AI as a resource as you complete assignments but not to answer the exercises for you. You are ultimately responsible for the work you turn in; it should reflect your understanding of the course content.\n:::\n\n# Questions?\n\n## Slack + GitHub username\n\n\\[instructions to join Slack workspace + get GitHub username email DM me\\]\n\n# statistical models\n\n\\[Add content on statistical models?\\]\n\n## **Before Monday**\n\n-   Complete Get to Know You survey\n\n-   Complete Slack tasks\n\n-   Review the [syllabus](https://sta310-sp24.netlify.app/syllabus/) and let me know if you have any questions\n\n-   Wednesday's reading:\n\n-   Get R and RStudio and configure git\n\n    -   Will use in class on Wed, Jan 17\n",
