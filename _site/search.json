These activities will be completed during lecture. As they are intended for practice, they will not be graded.\nPerform: Includes homework, quizzes, and the projects. These assignments are an opportunity for you to demonstrate your understanding of the course material and how it is applied to the analysis of real-world data.\n\n\nReadings\nThere will be reading assignments to accompany each topic. Readings will primarily come from the course textbook Beyond Multiple Linear Regression, but they may periodically include articles and other resources. It is strongly recommended that you complete the readings before lectures, so you have an introduction to the topic before class.\n\n\nLectures\nLectures will be interactive with a mix of presenting lecture notes, short in-class activities, and application exercises. The activities and application exercises will give you an opportunity to explore concepts in more depth and get practice applying them to real-world data.\n\n\nHomework\nThere will be 6 homework assignments during the semester. In these assignments, you will apply what you’ve learned as you answer conceptual questions and complete guided and unguided analyses. You may discuss homework assignments with other students; however, homework should be completed and submitted individually.\nThe lowest homework grade is dropped.\n\n\nQuizzes\nThere will be 6 quizzes during the semester. Quizzes will cover the readings, lecture notes and activities, and any assignments since the previous quiz.\nThe lowest quiz grade is dropped.\n\n\nProjects\nThere will be 2 short group projects and 1 final individual project in this course.

    "section": "Course policies",
    "text": "Course policies\n\nAcademic honesty\nBy participating in this course, you agree to abide by the following when completing assignments:\n\nThe homework assignments must be completed individually and you are welcomed to discuss the assignment with classmates at a high level (e.g., discuss what's the best way for approaching a problem, what functions are useful for accomplishing a particular task, etc.). However you may not directly share answers to homework questions (including any code) with anyone other than myself and the teaching assistants.\nYou may not discuss or otherwise work with others on quizzes. Unauthorized collaboration or using unauthorized materials will be considered a violation for all students involved.\nFor the projects collaboration within teams is not only allowed, but expected. Communication between teams at a high level is also allowed however you may not share code or components of the project across teams.\nReusing code: Unless explicitly stated otherwise, you may make use of online resources (e.g. StackOverflow) for coding examples on assignments. If you directly use code from an outside source (or use it as inspiration), you must explicitly cite where you obtained the code. Any recycled code that is discovered and is not explicitly cited will be treated as plagiarism.\nUse of artificial intelligence (AI): You should treat AI tools, such as ChatGPT, the same as other online resources. There are two guiding principles that govern how you can use AI in this course:2 (1) Cognitive dimension: Working with AI should not reduce your ability to think clearly. We will practice using AI to facilitate—rather than hinder—learning. (2) Ethical dimension: Students using AI should be transparent about their use and make sure it aligns with academic integrity.\n\nAI tools for code: You may make use of the technology for coding examples on assignments; if you do so, you must explicitly cite where you obtained the code. Any recycled code that is discovered and is not explicitly cited will be treated as plagiarism. You may use these guidelines for citing AI-generated content.\nNo AI tools for narrative: Unless instructed otherwise, AI is not permitted for writing narrative on assignments. In general, you may use AI as a resource as you complete assignments but not to answer the exercises for you. You are ultimately responsible for the work you turn in; it should reflect your understanding of the course content.\n\n\nIf you are unsure if the use of a particular resource complies with the academic honesty policy, please ask me or a teaching assistant.\nRegardless of course delivery format, it is the responsibility of all students to understand and follow all Duke policies, including academic integrity (e.g., completing one's own work, following proper citation of sources, adhering to guidance around group work projects,and more). Ignoring these requirements is a violation of the Duke Community Standard. Any questions and/or concerns regarding academic integrity can be directed to the Office of Student Conduct and Community Standards at conduct@duke.edu.\nAny violations in academic honesty standards as outlined in the Duke Community Standard and those specific to this course will automatically result in a 0 for the assignment and will be reported to the Office of Student Conduct for further action.\n\n\nLate work & extensions\nThe due dates for assignments are there to help you keep up with the course material and to ensure the teaching team can provide feedback within a timely manner. We understand that things come up periodically that could make it difficult to submit an assignment by the deadline.\n\nHomework will be accepted up to 48 hours after the deadline. There will be a 5% deduction for each 24-hour period the assignment is late.\nNo late work is accepted on quizzes, and there are no makeups for missed quizzes.\nLate policy for the project:\n\nPresentation: Late presentations are not accepted and there are no make ups for missed presentations.\nWrite up: GitHub repositories will be closed to contributions at the deadline. If you need to submit your work late, please send me a message via Slack or email to reopen your repository. There will be a 5% deduction for write ups submitted late but the same day (by 11:59pm). There will be a 10% deduction for write ups submitted the next day (by 11:59pm). There will be a 15% deduction for write ups submitted two days late (by 11:59pm). No credit given for write ups submitted more than 2 days after the deadline.\nPeer evaluation: Late peer evaluations are not accepted. If you do not turn in your peer evaluation, you get 0 points for your own peer score as well, regardless of how your teammates have evaluated you. There are no make ups for peer evaluations.\n\n\n\n\nLate waiver for extenuating circumstances\nIf there are circumstances that prevent you from completing a homework assignment by the deadline, you may email me before the deadline to waive the late penalty. In your email, you only need to request the waiver; you do not need to provide explanation. This waiver may only be used for once in the semester, so only use it for a truly extenuating circumstance.\nIf there are circumstances that are having a longer-term impact on your academic performance, please let your academic dean know, as they can be a resource. Please let me know if you need help contacting your academic dean.\n\n\nRegrade requests\nRegrade requests must be submitted via email to me within a week of when an assignment is returned. Regrade requests will only be considered if points were tallied incorrectly or a correct answer was mistakenly marked as incorrect. Requests to dispute the number of points deducted for an incorrect response will not be considered. If a regrade request is submitted, the entire question will be regraded, so your score could increase, decrease, or remain unchanged.\n\n\nAttendance\nYou are expected to attend all lectures and labs with a fully-charged laptop or tablet with access to RStudio. We understand there may be times when you are unable to attend a class meeting; in such instances it is your responsibility to make up the missed material. Labs will primarily be used to work on homework and the projects. If you miss a lab meeting dedicated to group work, please communicate with your teammates to make a plan to contribute to the assignment. Click here for more information on the Trinity attendance policies.\n\n\nAttendance Policy Related to COVID Symptoms, Exposure, or Infection\nStudent health, safety, and well-being are the university's top priorities. To help ensure your well-being and the well-being of those around you, please do not come to class if you have tested positive for COVID-19 or have possible symptoms and have not yet been tested. If any of these situations apply to you, you must follow university guidance related to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and current health and safety protocols. If you are experiencing any COVID-19 symptoms, contact student health (dshcheckin@duke.edu, 919-681-9355). Learn more about current university policy related to COVID-19 at coronavirus.duke.edu.\nTo keep the university community as safe and healthy as possible, you will be expected to follow these guidelines. Please reach out to me and your academic dean as soon as possible if you need to quarantine or isolate so that we can discuss arrangements for your continued participation in class."

We will highlight some of the scholars in the CURV data base through the “Statistician of the Day” during lecture each week.\nThere are two options for this statistics experience:\n1️⃣. Present the Statistician of the Day. Learn about one of the scholars in the CURV data base and present what you learn in class.\nA few guidelines:\n\nLet Professor Tackett know at least one week in advance of when you’d like to present a Statistician of the Day. They will take place at the beginning of lectures on Mondays.\nCreate 1 - 2 slides about the scholar.\nPresent at the beginning of lecture for both lectures. If you are unable to attend the beginning of both lectures, you can present in-person during your lecture period and provide a short video for the other lecture period.\n\n2️⃣ Contribute to the CURV data base. If there is a scholar you would like to suggest for the data base, submit your suggestion as an issue or pull request on the CURV GitHub repo and create a sample CURV page.\nA few guidelines:\n✅ Create a draft of the CURV page for your suggested scholar. For reference, click here for the CURV page for W.E.B. Du Bois. The page must be created in a Quarto document.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nYou can find the Quarto documents for current scholars in the data base in the CURV GitHub repo. You can use one of these as a template to format your page.\n\n\n✅ Make a pull request to the CURV GitHub repo to add the .qmd file for your suggested scholar, OR open an issue with a link to the .qmd file for your suggested scholar. You can ask a member of the teaching team if you have questions about how to do this.\n✅ Include the URL to your pull request or issue in your one-slide reflection."

In STA 310 students will be introduced to generalized linear models (GLMs), a broad modeling framework that includes linear and logistic models, among others. Students will learn the basic theory of GLMs and how they can used to model a variety of response variables with non-normal distributions. Students will also learn an extension of GLMs that can be applied to modeling data with correlated observations, such as data with repeated measures."

However your document should include all your code such that if I re-knit your Qmd file I should be able to obtain the results you presented.\n\nException: If you want to highlight something specific about a piece of code, you’re welcome to show that portion.\n\nMerge conflicts will happen, issues will arise, and that’s fine! Commit and push often, and ask questions when stuck.\nMake sure each team member is contributing, both in terms of quality and quantity of contribution (we will be reviewing commits from different team members).\nAll team members are expected to contribute equally to the completion of this assignment and group assessments will be given at its completion - anyone judged to not have sufficient contributed to the final product will have their grade penalized. While different teams members may have different backgrounds and abilities, it is the responsibility of every team member to understand how and why all code and approaches in the assignment works.\n\n\n\nFormatting + communication tips\n\nSuppress Code, Warnings, & Messages\n\nInclude the following code in a code chunk at the top of your .qmd file to suppress all code, warnings, and other messages. Use the code chunk header {r set-up, include = FALSE} to suppress this set up code.\n\nknitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE,\n                      warning = FALSE, \n                      message = FALSE)\n\nAn alternative approach is to add the following code to the YAML:\n\nexecute:\n  echo: false\n  warning: false\n  message: false\n\n\n\n\nHeaders\n\nUse headers to clearly label each section. Make sure there is a space between the last # and the title, so the header renders correctly. For example, ###Section Title will not render as header, but ### Section Title will.\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nInclude all references in a section called “References” at the end of the report.\nThis course does not have specific requirements for formatting citations and references.\n\n\n\nAppendix\n\nIf you have additional work that does not fit or does not belong in the body of the report, you may put it at the end of the document in section called “Appendix”.\nThe items in the appendix should be properly labeled.\nThe appendix should only be for additional material. The reader should be able to fully understand your report without viewing content in the appendix.\n\n\n\nResize figures\n\nResize plots and figures, so you have more space for the narrative.\n\nResize individual figures: Use the code chunk header {r plot1, fig.height = 3, fig.width = 5}, replacing plot1 with a meaningful label and the height and width with values appropriate for your write up.\nResize all figures: Include the fig_width and fig_height options in your YAML header as shown below:\n\n\n\n---\ntitle: \"Your title\"\nauthor: \"Your names\"\nformat:\n  pdf:\n    fig-width: 7\n    fig-height: 5\n---\nReplace the height and width values with values appropriate for your write up.\n\n\nArranging plots\nArrange plots in a grid, instead of one after the other. This is especially useful when displaying plots for exploratory data analysis and to check assumptions.\n\nIf you’re using ggplot2 functions, the patchwork package makes it easy to arrange plots in a grid. See the documentation and examples here.\nIf you’re using base R function, i.e. when using the emplogit functions, put the code par(mfrow = c(rows,columns)) before the code to make the plots. For example, par(mfrow = c(2,3)) will arrange plots in a grid with 2 rows and 3 columns.\n\n\n\nPlot titles and axis labels\nBe sure all plot titles and axis labels are visible and easy to read.\n\nUse informative titles, not variable names, for titles and axis labels.\nUse coord_flip() to flip the x and y axes on the plot. This is useful if you a bar plot with an x-axis that is difficult to read due to overlapping text.\n\n❌ NO! The x-axis is hard to read because the names overlap.\n\nggplot(data = mpg, aes(x = manufacturer)) +\n  geom_bar()\n\n\n\n\n✅ YES! Names are readable\n\nggplot(data = mpg, aes(x = manufacturer)) +\n  geom_bar() +\n  coord_flip()\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo a little more to make the plot look professional!\n\nInformative title and axis labels\nFlipped coordinates to make names readable\nArranged bars based on count\nCapitalized manufacturer names\nOptional: Added color - Use a coordinated color scheme throughout paper / presentation\nOptional: Applied a theme - Use same theme throughout paper / presentation\n\n\nmpg |&gt;\n  count(manufacturer) |&gt;\n  mutate(manufacturer = str_to_title(manufacturer)) |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = fct_reorder(manufacturer,n), y = n)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", fill = \"steelblue\") +\n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(x = \"Manufacturer\", \n       y = \"Count\", \n       title = \"The most common manufacturer is Dodge\") +\n  theme_bw() \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTables and model output\n\nUse the kable function from the knitr package to neatly output all tables and model output. This will also ensure all model coefficients are displayed.\n\nUse the digits argument to display only 3 or 4 significant digits.\nUse the caption argument to add captions to your table.\n\n\n\nmodel &lt;- lm(mpg ~ hp, data = mtcars)\ntidy(model) |&gt;\n  kable(digits = 3)\n\n\n\n\nterm\nestimate\nstd.error\nstatistic\np.value\n\n\n\n\n(Intercept)\n30.099\n1.634\n18.421\n0\n\n\nhp\n-0.068\n0.010\n-6.742\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGuidelines for communicating results\n\nDon’t use variable names in your narrative! Use descriptive terms, so the reader understands your narrative without relying on the data dictionary.\n\n❌ There is a negative linear relationship between mpg and hp.\n✅ There is a negative linear relationship between a car’s fuel economy (in miles per gallon) and its horsepower.\n\nKnow your audience: Your report should be written for a general audience who has an understanding of statistics at the level of STA 210.\nAvoid subject matter jargon: Don’t assume the audience knows all of the specific terminology related to your subject area. If you must use jargon, include a brief definition the first time you introduce a term.\nTell the “so what”: Your report and presentation should be more than a list of interpretations and technical definitions. Focus on what the results mean, i.e. what you want the audience to know about your topic after reading your report or viewing your presentation.\n\n❌ For every one unit increase in horsepower, we expect the miles per gallon to decrease by 0.068 units, on average.\n✅ If the priority is to have good fuel economy, then one should choose a car with lower horsepower. Based on our model, the fuel economy is expected to decrease, on average, by 0.68 miles per gallon for every 10 additional horsepower.\n\nTell a story: All visualizations, tables, model output, and narrative should tell a cohesive story!\nUse one voice: Though multiple people are writing the report, it should read as if it’s from a single author. At least one team member should read through the report before submission to ensure it reads like a cohesive document.\n\n\n\n\nAdditional resources\n\nExploring RStudio’s Visual Markdown Editor\nR for Data Science\nQuarto documentation:\n\nQuarto PDF Basics\nPresentations in Quarto\n\nData visualization\n\nggplot2 Reference\nggplot2: Elegant Graphics for Data Analysis\nData Visualization: A Practice Introduction\nPatchwork R Package"
