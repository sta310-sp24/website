Citizens of this community commit to reflect upon these principles in all academic and non-academic endeavors, and to protect and promote a culture of integrity.\nTo uphold the Duke Community Standard, students agree:\n\n\nI will not lie, cheat, or steal in my academic endeavors;\nI will conduct myself honorably in all my endeavors;and\nI will act if the Standard is compromised.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInclusive community\nIt is my intent that students from all diverse backgrounds and perspectives be well-served by this course, that students’ learning needs be addressed both in and out of class, and that the diversity that the students bring to this class be viewed as a resource, strength, and benefit. It is my intent to present materials and activities that are respectful of diversity and in alignment with Duke’s Commitment to Diversity and Inclusion. Your suggestions are encouraged and appreciated. Please let me know ways to improve the effectiveness of the course for you personally, or for other students or student groups.\nFurthermore, I would like to create a learning environment for my students that supports a diversity of thoughts, perspectives and experiences, and honors your identities. To help accomplish this:\n\nIf you feel like your performance in the class is being impacted by your experiences outside of class, please don’t hesitate to come and talk with me. If you prefer to speak with someone outside of the course, your academic dean is an excellent resource.\nI (like many people) am still in the process of learning about diverse perspectives and identities. If something was said in class (by anyone) that made you feel uncomfortable, please let me or a member of the teaching team know.\n\n\n\nPronouns\nPronouns are meaningful tools to communicate identities and experiences, and using pronouns supports a campus environment where all community members can thrive. Please update your gender pronouns in Duke Hub. You can learn more at the Center for Sexual and Gender Diversity’s website.\n\n\nAccessibility\nIf there is any portion of the course that is not accessible to you due to challenges with technology or the course format, please let me know so we can make appropriate accommodations.\nThe Student Disability Access Office (SDAO) is available to ensure that students are able to engage with their courses and related assignments. Students should be in touch with the Student Disability Access Office to request or update accommodations under these circumstances.\n\n\nCommunication\nAll lecture notes, assignment instructions, an up-to-date schedule, and other course materials may be found on the course website, sta210-fa23.netlify.app.\nLinks to Zoom meetings may be found in Sakai. Periodic announcements will be sent via email and will also be available through Ed Discussion and Sakai Announcements. Please check your email regularly to ensure you have the latest announcements for the course.\n\n\nGetting help in the course\n\nIf you have a question during lecture or lab, feel free to ask it! There are likely other students with the same question, so by asking you will create a learning opportunity for everyone.\nThe teaching team is here to help you be successful in the course. You are encouraged to attend office hours1 to ask questions about the course content and assignments. Many questions are most effectively answered as you discuss them with others, so office hours are a valuable resource. You are encouraged to use them!\nOutside of class and office hours, any general questions about course content or assignments should be posted on the class discussion forum Ed Discussion. There is a chance another student has already asked a similar question, so please check the other posts in Ed Discussion before adding a new question. If you know the answer to a question posted in the discussion forum, you are encouraged to respond!\n\n\n\nEmail\nIf you have questions about assignment extensions or accommodations, please email sta210@duke.edu. This email address is accessible to me and the head TA. Please see Assignment extensions for more information. If you have any other questions that are not appropriate for the public forum, you are welcome to email me directly at maria.tackett@duke.edu. If you email me, please include “STA 210” in the subject line. Barring extenuating circumstances, I will respond to STA 210 emails within 48 hours Monday - Friday. Response time may be slower for emails sent Friday evening - Sunday.\nCheck out the Support page for more resources."

A lot of what you do in this course will involve writing code, and coding is a skill that is best learned by doing. Therefore, as much as possible, you will be working on a variety of tasks and activities throughout each lecture and lab. You are expected to prepare for class by completing assigned readings, attend all lecture and lab sessions, and meaningfully contribute to in-class exercises and discussion. Additionally, some lectures will feature application exercises that will be graded based on completing what we do in class.\nYou are expected to bring a laptop, tablet, or Chromebook to each class so that you can participate in the in-class exercises. Please make sure your device is fully charged before you come to class, as the number of outlets in the classroom will not be sufficient to accommodate everyone."

    "text": "Activities & Assessment\nYou will be assessed based on six components: application exercises, homework, labs, exams, project, and teamwork.\n\nApplication Exercises\nParts of some lectures will be dedicated to working on Application Exercises (AEs). These exercises which give you an opportunity to practice apply the statistical concepts and code introduced in the prepare assignment. These AEs are due within three days of the corresponding lecture period. Specifically, AEs from Monday lectures are due Thursday by 11:59p ET, and AEs from Wednesday lectures are due Saturday by 11:59p ET.\nBecause these AEs are for practice, they will be graded based on making a good-faith effort in attempting all questions covered in class. You are welcome to, but not required, to work on AEs beyond lecture. Successful on-time effort on at least 80% of AEs will result in full credit for AEs in the final course grade. Because AEs are intended for in-class activities, there are no extensions given on AEs.\n\n\nLabs\nIn labs, you will apply the concepts discussed in lecture to various data analysis scenarios, with a focus on the computation and communication. Most lab assignments will be completed in teams, and all team members are expected to contribute equally to the completion of each assignment. You are expected to use the team’s Git repository on the course’s GitHub page as the central platform for collaboration. Commits to this repository will be used as a metric of each team member’s relative contribution for each lab, and there will be periodic peer evaluation on the team collaboration. Lab assignments will be completed using Quarto, correspond to an appropriate GitHub repository, and submitted for grading in Gradescope.\nThe lowest lab grade will be dropped at the end of the semester.\n\n\nHomework\nIn homework, you will apply what you’ve learned during lecture and lab to complete data analysis tasks. You may discuss homework assignments with other students; however, homework should be completed and submitted individually. Similar to lab assignments, homework must be typed up using Quarto and GitHub and submitted as a PDF in Gradescope.\nOne homework assignment will be dedicated to a statistics experience. The statistics experience is an opportunity to engage with statistics and data science outside of the classroom through podcasts, books, seminars, data analysis competitions, and other activities. As you complete these experiences, the goal is to consider how the material you’re learning in the course connects with society more broadly.\nThe lowest homework grade will be dropped at the end of the semester.\n\n\nExams\nThere will be two exams in this course. Each exam will include a closed-notes in-class component and an open-note take-home component. Through these exams you have the opportunity to demonstrate what you’ve learned in the course thus far. The exams will focus on both conceptual understanding of the content and application through analysis and computational tasks. The content of the exam will be related to the content in reading assignments, lectures, application exercises, homework, and lab assignments. More detail about the exams will be given during the semester.\n\n\nProject\nThe purpose of the final project is to apply what you’ve learned throughout the semester to analyze an interesting data-driven research question. The project will be completed with your lab teams, and each team will present their work through a written report and presentation. More information about the project will be provided during the semester."

Your TAs and I will help you be providing you with materials and answering questions and setting a pace, but for this to work you must do the following:\n\nComplete all the preparation work before class.\nAsk questions. As often as you can. In class, out of class. Ask me, ask the TAs, ask your friends, ask the person sitting next to you. This will help you more than anything else. If you get a question wrong on an assessment, ask us why. If you’re not sure about the homework, ask. If you hear something on the news that sounds related to what we discussed, ask. If the reading is confusing, ask.\nDo the readings.\nDo the homework and lab.The earlier you start, the better. It’s not enough to just mechanically plow through the exercises. You should ask yourself how these exercises relate to earlier material, and imagine how they might be changed (to make questions for an exam, for example.)\nDon’t procrastinate. The content builds upon what was taught in previous weeks, so if something is confusing to you in Week 2, Week 3 will become more confusing, Week 4 even worse, etc. Don’t let the week end with unanswered questions. But if you find yourself falling behind and not knowing where to begin asking, come to office hours and work with a member of the teaching team to help you identify a good (re)starting point."

    "text": "Course policies\n\nAcademic honesty\nTL;DR: Don’t cheat!\n\nOnly work that is clearly assigned as team work should be completed collaboratively.\n\n\n\nThe homework assignments must be completed individually and you are welcomed to discuss the assignment with classmates at a high level (e.g., discuss what’s the best way for approaching a problem, what functions are useful for accomplishing a particular task, etc.). However you may not directly share answers to homework questions (including any code) with anyone other than myself and the teaching assistants.\nYou may not discuss or otherwise work with others on the exams. Unauthorized collaboration or using unauthorized materials will be considered a violation for all students involved. More details will be given closer to the exam date.\nFor the projects and team labs, collaboration within teams is not only allowed, but expected. Communication between teams at a high level is also allowed however you may not share code or components of the project or team labs across teams.\nReusing code: Unless explicitly stated otherwise, you may make use of online resources (e.g. StackOverflow) for coding examples on assignments. If you directly use code from an outside source (or use it as inspiration), you must explicitly cite where you obtained the code. Any recycled code that is discovered and is not explicitly cited will be treated as plagiarism.\nUse of artificial intelligence (AI): You should treat AI tools, such as ChatGPT, the same as other online resources. There are two guiding principles that govern how you can use AI in this course:2 (1) Cognitive dimension: Working with AI should not reduce your ability to think clearly. We will practice using AI to facilitate—rather than hinder—learning. (2) Ethical dimension: Students using AI should be transparent about their use and make sure it aligns with academic integrity.\n\nAI tools for code: You may make use of the technology for coding examples on assignments; if you do so, you must explicitly cite where you obtained the code. Any recycled code that is discovered and is not explicitly cited will be treated as plagiarism. You may use these guidelines for citing AI-generated content.\nNo AI tools for narrative: Unless instructed otherwise, AI is not permitted for writing narrative on assignments. In general, you may use AI as a resource as you complete assignments but not to answer the exercises for you. You are ultimately responsible for the work you turn in; it should reflect your understanding of the course content.\n\n\nIf you are unsure if the use of a particular resource complies with the academic honesty policy, please ask a member of the teaching team.\nRegardless of course delivery format, it is the responsibility of all students to understand and follow all Duke policies, including academic integrity (e.g., completing one’s own work, following proper citation of sources, adhering to guidance around group work projects,and more).Ignoring these requirements is a violation of the Duke Community Standard. Any questions and/or concerns regarding academic integrity can be directed to the Office of Student Conduct and Community Standards at conduct@duke.edu.\n\n\nLate work policy\nThe due dates for assignments are there to help you keep up with the course material and to ensure the teaching team can provide feedback within a timely manner. We understand that things come up periodically that could make it difficult to submit an assignment by the deadline. Note that the lowest homework and lab assignment will be dropped to accommodate such circumstances.\n\nHomework and labs may be submitted up to 2 days late. There will be a 5% deduction for each 24-hour period the assignment is late.\nThere is no late work is accepted for application exercises, since these are designed as in-class activities to help you prepare for labs and homework.\nThe late work policy for exams will be provided with the exam instructions.\nThe late work policy for the project will be provided with the project instructions.\n\n\n\nWaiver for extenuating circumstances\nIf there are circumstances that prevent you from completing a lab or homework assignment by the stated due date, you may email sta210@duke.edu before the deadline to waive the late penalty. In your email, you only need to request the waiver; you do not need to provide explanation. This waiver may only be used once in the semester, so only use it for a truly extenuating circumstance.\nIf there are circumstances that are having a longer-term impact on your academic performance, please let your academic dean know, as they can be a resource. Please let me know if you need help contacting your academic dean.\n\n\nAssignment extensions\nSam Rosen (sta210@duke.edu) will serve as the Head TA this semester. Among many things, Sam’s role is to handle all assignment extension questions. This includes answering questions about the late work policy, along with granting extensions based on the documented arrangements for accommodations and extenuating circumstances via the one-time late waiver or documentation from the Academic Dean. Please see Late work policy and Waiver for extenuating circumstances for more information about these policies.\nPlease direct all questions about late work policies to sta210@duke.edu. This email will be directed to Sam and myself. This email address only accept emails from Duke email addresses.\n\n\nRegrade Requests\nRegrade requests must be submitted on Gradescope within a week of when an assignment is returned. Regrade requests will be considered if there was an error in the grade calculation or if you feel a correct answer was mistakenly marked as incorrect. Requests to dispute the number of points deducted for an incorrect response will not be considered. Note that by submitting a regrade request, the entire question will be graded which could potentially result in losing points.\nNo grades will be changed after the final project presentations.\n\n\nAttendance policy\nEvery student is expected to attend and participate in lecture and labs. There may be times, however, when you cannot attend class. Lecture recordings are available upon request for students who have an excused absence. See the Lecture recording request policy for more detail. If you miss a lecture, make sure to review the material and complete the application exercise, if applicable, before the next lecture. Labs dedicated to completing the lab assignment and collaborating with your lab team. If you miss a lab session, make sure to communicate with your lab TA and teammates about how you can make up your contribution. If you know you’re going to miss a lab session and you’re feeling well enough to do so, notify your lab TA and teammates ahead of time.\nMore details on Trinity attendance policies are available here.\n\nAttendance Policy Related to COVID Symptoms, Exposure, or Infection\nStudent health, safety, and well-being are the university’s top priorities. To help ensure your well-being and the well-being of those around you, please do not come to class if you have tested positive for COVID-19 or have possible symptoms and have not yet been tested. If any of these situations apply to you, you must follow university guidance related to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and current health and safety protocols. If you are experiencing any COVID-19 symptoms, contact student health (dshcheckin@duke.edu, 919-681-9355). Learn more about current university policy related to COVID-19 at coronavirus.duke.edu.\nTo keep the university community as safe and healthy as possible, you will be expected to follow these guidelines. Please reach out to me and your academic dean as soon as possible if you need to quarantine or isolate so that we can discuss arrangements for your continued participation in class.\n\n\n\nLecture recording request\nLectures will be recorded on Panopto and will be made available to students with an excused absence upon request. Videos shared with such students will be available for a week after the lecture date. To request a particular lecture’s video, please fill out the form at forms.office.com/r/FbRXJm4Ln1. Please submit the form within 24 hours of missing lecture to ensure you have sufficient time to watch the recording. Please also make sure that any official documentation, such as STINFs, Dean’s excuses, NOVAPs, and quarantine/removal from class notices from student health are also uploaded to the form.\nAbout one week before each exam, the class recordings will be available to all students. These recordings will be available until 10am the day of the exam."

You do not have to do one these suggested activities. You are welcome to find other activities as long as they are related to statistics/data science and they fit in one of the six categories. If there is an activity you’d like to do but you’re not sure if it qualifies for the statistics experience, just ask!\n\nCategory 1: Attend a talk or conference\nAttend an talk, panel, or conference related to statistics or data science. If you are attending a single talk or panel, it must be at least 30 minutes to count towards the statistics experience. The event can be in-person or online.\n\n\nCategory 2: Talk with a statistician/ data scientist\nTalk with someone who uses statistics in their daily work. This could include a professor, professional in industry, graduate student, etc.\n\n\nCategory 3: Listen to a podcast / watch video\nListen to a podcast or watch a video about statistics and data science. The podcast or video must be at least 30 minutes to count towards the statistics experience. A few suggestions are below:\n\nStats + Stories Podcast\nCausal Inference Podcast\nFiveThirtyEight Model Talk\nrstudio::conf talks\n\n2022 conference\n2021 conference\n2020 conference\n\n\nThis list is not exhaustive. You may listen to other podcasts or watch other statistics/data science videos not included on this list. Ask Professor Tackett if you are unsure whether a particular podcast or video will count towards the statistics experience.\n\n\nCategory 4: Participate in a data science competition or challenge\nParticipate in a statistics or data science competition. You can participate individually or with a team.\n\n\nCategory 5: Read a book on statistics/data science\nThere are a lot of books about statistics, data science, and related topics. A few suggestions are below. If you decide to read a book that isn’t on this list, ask Professor Tackett to make sure it counts toward the experience. Many of these books are available through Duke library.\n\nWeapons of Math Destruction by Cathy O’Neil\nHow Charts Lie: Getting Smarter about Visual Information by Alberto Cairo\nThe Theory that Would Not Die by Sharon Bertsch McGrayne\nThe Art of Statistics: How to learn from data by David Spiegelhalter\nThe Signal and the Noise: Why so many predictions fail - but some don’t by Nate Silver\nList of books about data science ethics\n\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nCategory 6: TidyTuesday\nYou may also participate in a TidyTuesday challenge. New data sets are announced on Monday afternoons.You can find more information about TidyTuesday and see the data in the TidyTuesday GitHub repo.\nA few guidelines:\n✅ Create a GitHub repo for your TidyTuesday submission. Your repo should include\n\nThe R Markdown file with all the code needed to reproduce your visualization.\nA README that includes an image of your final visualization and a short summary (~ 1 paragraph) about your visualization.\n\n✅ The visualization should include features or customization that are beyond what we’ve done in class .\n✅ Include the link to your GitHub repo in the slide summarizing your experience.\n\n\nCategory 7: CURV - connecting, uplifting, and recognizing voices\nCURV is a project by Dr. Jo Hardin at Pomona College to highlight statisticians and data scientists from groups who have been historically marginalized in the discipline. We will highlight some of the scholars in the CURV data base through the “Statistician of the Day” during lecture each week.\nThere are two options for this statistics experience:\n1️⃣. Present the Statistician of the Day. Learn about one of the scholars in the CURV data base and present what you learn in class.\nA few guidelines:\n\nLet Professor Tackett know at least one week in advance of when you’d like to present a Statistician of the Day. They will take place at the beginning of lectures on Mondays.\nCreate 1 - 2 slides about the scholar.\nPresent at the beginning of lecture for both lectures. If you are unable to attend the beginning of both lectures, you can present in-person during your lecture period and provide a short video for the other lecture period.\n\n2️⃣ Contribute to the CURV data base. If there is a scholar you would like to suggest for the data base, submit your suggestion as an issue or pull request on the CURV GitHub repo and create a sample CURV page.\nA few guidelines:\n✅ Create a draft of the CURV page for your suggested scholar. For reference, click here for the CURV page for W.E.B. Du Bois. The page must be created in a Quarto document.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nYou can find the Quarto documents for current scholars in the data base in the CURV GitHub repo. You can use one of these as a template to format your page.\n\n\n✅ Make a pull request to the CURV GitHub repo to add the .qmd file for your suggested scholar, OR open an issue with a link to the .qmd file for your suggested scholar. You can ask a member of the teaching team if you have questions about how to do this.\n✅ Include the URL to your pull request or issue in your one-slide reflection."

    "section": "Sum of squares in ANOVA table",
    "text": "Sum of squares in ANOVA table\nR uses a sequential method to calculate sum of squares for the variables in the model. This means that the sum of squares attributed to each variable is the variation in the response explained by that variable after accounting for the total variation explained by the other variables already in the model.\nThe order of the sequence is determined by the order of the variables in the model fit code. This order is reflected in the order the variables appear in the ANOVA output. The sequential sum of squares attributed to each variable will change if the order of the variables in the model changes; however, the sum of squares attributed to the model overall will not change, regardless of the order of the variables.\nLet’s take a look at the sum of squares for Party, the first variable in the model. This value is calculated as the total variation in Tips explained by Party only. We can calculate this value by looking at the ANOVA table for simple linear regression model where Party is the only predictor.\n\nparty_fit &lt;- linear_reg() |&gt;\n  set_engine(\"lm\") |&gt;\n  fit(Tip ~ Party, data = tips)\n\nanova(party_fit$fit) |&gt;\n  tidy() |&gt;\n  kable(digits = 2)\n\n\n\n\nterm\ndf\nsumsq\nmeansq\nstatistic\np.value\n\n\n\n\nParty\n1\n1188.64\n1188.64\n274\n0\n\n\nResiduals\n167\n724.47\n4.34\nNA\nNA\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that the sum of squares in this table is the value of \\(SS_{Party}\\) above.\nNext, let’s add Age to the model. The sum of squares associated with Age is the additional variation in Tips explained by Age after accounting for variation explained by Party. This can be understood as the additional model variation in the model with Party and Age compared to a model that only includes Party. We can calculate this additional variation as follows:\n\nanova(party_fit$fit, tip_fit$fit) |&gt;\n  tidy() |&gt;\n  kable(digits = 2)\n\n\n\n\nterm\ndf.residual\nrss\ndf\nsumsq\nstatistic\np.value\n\n\n\n\nTip ~ Party\n167\n724.47\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\n\n\nTip ~ Party + Age\n165\n686.44\n2\n38.03\n4.57\n0.01\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that the sum of squares in this table is the value of \\(SS_{Age|Party}\\) above.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWhen we input two model is the anova() function, e.g., anova(Model 1, Model 2), the output produced is the additional sum of squares accounted for by the new variable(s) in Model 2 after accounting for the variables in Model 1. In this case, it is the additional sum of squares accounted for by Age after accounting for Party.\n\n\nWhen we use the ANOVA table, we are most interested in the variation in the response explained by the entire model, not the contribution from each variable. Therefore, we will primarily consider the \\(SS_{Model}\\), Sum of Squares Model. Because sum of squares are additive, it can be calculated as\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nSS_{Model} &= SS_{Total} - SS_{Error} \\\\\n&= 1913.11 - 686.44 \\\\\n& = 1226.67\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]It can also be calculated as\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nSS_{Model} &= SS_{Party} + SS_{Age | Party} \\\\\n& = 1188.64 + 38.03 \\\\\n& = 1226.67\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]"

It includes many techniques for modeling and analyzing several variables, when the focus is on the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables (or ‘predictors’). More specifically, regression analysis helps one understand how the typical value of the dependent variable (or ‘criterion variable’) changes when any one of the independent variables is varied, while the other independent variables are held fixed.”\n\nSource: Wikipedia (previous definition)"

If you’re unsure where to find data, you can use the list of potential data sources on the Tips + resources page as a starting point. It may also help to think of topics you’re interested in investigating and find data sets on those topics.\nThe data set must meet the following criteria:\n\nAt least 500 observations\nAt least 10 columns, such that at least 6 of the columns are useful and unique predictor variables.\n\nE.g., identifier variables such as “name”, “social security number”, etc. are not useful predictor variables.\nE.g., if you have multiple columns with the same information (e.g. “state abbreviation” and “state name”), then they are not unique predictors.\n\nAt least one variable that can be identified as a reasonable response variable.\n\nThe response variable can be quantitative or categorical.\n\nA mix of quantitative and categorical variables that can be used as predictors.\nMay not be data that has previously been used in any course materials, or any derivation of data that has been used in course materials.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTypes of data sets to avoid\n\n\n\n\nData that are likely violate the independence condition. Therefore, avoid data with repeated measures, data collected over time, etc.\nData sets in which there is no information about how the data were originally collected\nData sets in which there are missing or unclear definitions about the variables\n\n\n\nAsk a member of the teaching team if you’re unsure whether your data set meets the criteria.\nThe proposal will include the following:\n\nSection 1: Introduction\nThe introduction section includes\n\nan introduction to the subject matter you’re investigating (citing any relevant literature)\nthe motivation for your research question (citing any relevant literature)\nthe primary research question you are interested in exploring\nyour team's hypotheses regarding the research question\n\nThis is narrative about what you think regarding the research question, not formal statistical hypotheses.\n\n\n\n\nSection 2: Data description\nThe data description section includes\n\nthe source of the data set\ndescription of how when and how the data were originally collected (by the original data curator, not necessarily how you found the data)\ndescription of the observations and general characteristics being measured\n\n\n\nSection 3: Initial exploratory data analysis\nIn this section, you will begin to explore the data. This includes using narrative, visualizations and summary statistics to describe the following:\n\ndistribution of the response variable\ndistributions of one potential quantitative predictor variable and one potential categorical predictor variable\nthe relationships between the response variable and each of the predictors from the previous step\na potential interaction effect you’re interested in exploring (it doesn’t have to be an interaction with the two predictors from above)\n\nThese steps are just to get your started on exploratory data analysis and will not be the complete EDA for the final report. The requirements above are the minimum requirements, but your group is welcome to include more at this stage.\nIn this section, you will also describe any data cleaning you need to do to prepare for modeling, such as imputing missing values, collapsing levels for categorical predictors, creating new variables, summarizing data, etc.\n\n\nSection 4: Analysis approach\nIn this section, you will provide a brief overview of your analysis approach. This includes\n\ndescription of the response variable and list of all potential predictors\nregression model technique (multiple linear regression or logistic regression)\n\n\n\nData dictionary (aka code book)\nSubmit a data dictionary for all the variables in your data set in the README of the data folder. You do not need to include the data dictionary in the PDF document.\n\n\nSubmission\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nWrite your narrative for Sections 1 - 4 in the proposal.qmd file. Put the data set and the data dictionary in the data folder.\nSubmit the PDF of the proposal to Gradescope. Mark all pages of the document.\n\n\n\n\nGrading\nThe anticipated length, including all graphs, tables, narrative, etc., is 2 -4 pages; it may not exceed 5 pages.\nThe proposal is worth 15 points and will be graded based on accurately and comprehensively addressing the criteria stated above. Points will be assigned based on a holistic review of the project proposal.\n\nExcellent (14 - 15 points) : All required elements are completed and are accurate. There is a thorough exploration of the data and the team has demonstrated a careful and thoughtful approach exploring the data and preparing it for analysis. The narrative is written clearly, all tables and visualizations are nicely formatted, and the work would be presentable in a professional setting.\nStrong: (11 - 13 points): Requirements are mostly met, but there are some elements that are incomplete or inaccurate. Some minor revision of the work required before team is ready for modeling.\nSatisfactory (8 - 10 points): Requirements partially met, but there are some elements that are incomplete and/or inaccurate. Major revision of the work required before team is ready for modeling.\nNeeds Improvement (7 or fewer points points): Requirements are largely unmet, and there are large elements that are incomplete and/or inaccurate. Substantial revisions of the work required before team is ready for modeling. --&gt;"

    "text": "Evaluate response from ChatGPT\nI typed the following prompt into ChatGPT (“an AI powered language model”) “How do you check the model conditions for simple linear regression?”\nThe response from ChatGPT shown below would receive partial credit. For each condition, state whether it is (1) correct, (2) incorrect and if so, what is wrong, (3) incomplete and if so, what is missing.\n\nIn simple linear regression, you’re trying to establish a linear relationship between two variables: a dependent variable (Y) and an independent variable (X). The model conditions or assumptions for simple linear regression are important to check to ensure that your model is valid and reliable. Here are the key assumptions and how to check them:\n1. Linearity Assumption:\n\nAssumption: The relationship between the independent variable (X) and the dependent variable (Y) is linear.\nHow to Check: Create a scatterplot of Y against X. If the points roughly form a straight line, the linearity assumption is likely met.\n\n2. Independence Assumption:\n\nAssumption: The residuals (the differences between observed Y and predicted Y) are independent of each other.\nHow to Check: Plot the residuals against the independent variable (X) or the predicted values. Look for patterns or trends in the residuals. There should be no clear structure or autocorrelation in the residuals.\n\n3. Homoscedasticity [Constant variance] Assumption:\n\nAssumption: The variance of the residuals is constant across all levels of the independent variable.\nHow to Check: Plot the residuals against the predicted values or the independent variable (X). The spread of the residuals should remain roughly constant across the range of X.\n\n4. Normality Assumption:\n\nAssumption: The residuals follow a normal distribution.\nHow to Check: Create a histogram or a normal probability plot (Q-Q plot) of the residuals. If the residuals are approximately normally distributed, they should follow a bell-shaped curve in the histogram and lie along a straight line in the Q-Q plot.\n\nIt’s important to note that these assumptions may not always hold perfectly in real-world data, and minor violations may not necessarily invalidate your model. However, if you detect significant violations of these assumptions, you may need to consider alternative modeling techniques or transformations of your data to address the issues.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nYou will start to think about the answer in class and come up with a final answer with your group in Lab 04."

    "text": "Exercise 3\nBefore using the model for prediction, let’s check the model conditions. To figure out how to do so, we type the following prompt into ChatGPT (“an AI powered language model”) “How do you check the model conditions for simple linear regression?”\nThe response from ChatGPT shown below would receive partial credit. For each condition, state whether it is correct or incorrect/ incomplete. If it incorrect/incomplete, state what is wrong or missing, then write the correct response.\n\nIn simple linear regression, you’re trying to establish a linear relationship between two variables: a dependent variable (Y) and an independent variable (X). The model conditions or assumptions for simple linear regression are important to check to ensure that your model is valid and reliable. Here are the key assumptions and how to check them:\n1. Linearity Assumption:\n\nAssumption: The relationship between the independent variable (X) and the dependent variable (Y) is linear.\nHow to Check: Create a scatterplot of Y against X. If the points roughly form a straight line, the linearity assumption is likely met.\n\n2. Independence Assumption:\n\nAssumption: The residuals (the differences between observed Y and predicted Y) are independent of each other.\nHow to Check: Plot the residuals against the independent variable (X) or the predicted values. Look for patterns or trends in the residuals. There should be no clear structure or autocorrelation in the residuals.\n\n3. Homoscedasticity [Constant variance] Assumption:\n\nAssumption: The variance of the residuals is constant across all levels of the independent variable.\nHow to Check: Plot the residuals against the predicted values or the independent variable (X). The spread of the residuals should remain roughly constant across the range of X.\n\n4. Normality Assumption:\n\nAssumption: The residuals follow a normal distribution.\nHow to Check: Create a histogram or a normal probability plot (Q-Q plot) of the residuals. If the residuals are approximately normally distributed, they should follow a bell-shaped curve in the histogram and lie along a straight line in the Q-Q plot.\n\nIt’s important to note that these assumptions may not always hold perfectly in real-world data, and minor violations may not necessarily invalidate your model. However, if you detect significant violations of these assumptions, you may need to consider alternative modeling techniques or transformations of your data to address the issues.\n\n\n✅ ⬆️ Team Member 2: Knit, commit and push your changes to GitHub with an appropriate commit message again.

Call the training set candy_train and the testing set candy_test. Use a seed of 2.\n\n\nExercise 3\nBelow is a recipe for a model that uses the characteristics of candy to understand variability in the win percentage. The lines of the recipe code are labeled Line 1 - Line 9. Describe what each line of code does. The explanation should be written comprehensively and specifically enough that someone could replicate the data manipulation steps based on your description.\nFor example, if a line of code is step_center(X), a comprehensive and specific explanation something similar to the following: “This line of code mean centers the variable \\(X\\) by subtracting \\(\\bar{X}\\) from each value of \\(X\\) in the training data.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nUse the Recipes Function Reference page as a resource to learn more about the step_ functions.\n\n\n\n#Line 1\ncandy_rec &lt;- recipe(winpercent ~ ., data = candy_train) |&gt; \n#Line 2\n  update_role(competitorname, new_role = \"ID\") |&gt; \n# Line 3\n  step_cut(sugarpercent, breaks = c(0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1)) |&gt; \n#Line 4\n  step_mutate(pricepercent = pricepercent * 100) |&gt; \n#Line 5\n  step_dummy(all_nominal_predictors()) |&gt; \n#Line 6\n  step_interact(terms =~ pricepercent:chocolate) |&gt; \n#Line 7\n  step_interact(terms =~ peanutyalmondy:chocolate) |&gt; \n#Line 8\n  step_rm(fruity, caramel, hard, pluribus, bar, nougat, crispedricewafer) |&gt; \n#Line 9\n  step_zv(all_predictors()) \n\n\n\nExercise 4\nFill in the code to use prep and bake for a preview of what will happen when the recipe in Exercise 3 is applied.\n\ncandy_rec |&gt;\n  prep() |&gt;\n  bake(_____) |&gt;\n  glimpse()\n\nHow many terms (not including the intercept) will be in the model produced by this recipe?\n\n\nExercise 5\nFill in the code to specify model, build the model workflow using the recipe in Exercise 2, and fit the model to the training data.

Use the recipe workflow to fit a new model that meets the following criteria:\n\nIncludes variables chocolate, pricepercent, crispedricewafer, peanutyalmondy, sugarpercent\nUpdate pricepercent so it ranges from 0 to 100 (instead of 0 to 1)\nMakes sugarpercent a factor where the levels equal the four quartiles: 0 - 0.25, 0.25 - 0.50, 0.50 - 0.75, 0.75 - 1\nIncludes the interaction between pricepercent and peanutyalmondy\n\nNeatly display the model using 3 digits.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nSee the Function Reference page on recipes.tidymodels.org to find the appropriate recipe functions.\n\n\n\n\nExercise 8\n\nConsider the model from Exercise 5 “Model 1” and the model fit in Exercise 7 “Model 2”. Use the glance() function to calculate \\(R^2\\) for both of these models.\nWhich model would you choose based on \\(R^2\\)? Briefly explain your choice.\n\n\n\nExercise 9\nWe will use RMSE to evalulate the predictive performance of each model on the testing data.\n\nUse the code below to calculate predicted values and RMSE for Model 1 on the testing data. Then get the RMSE for Model 2 on the testing data.\n\n\npredict_test1 &lt;- predict(candy_fit, candy_test) |&gt; \n  bind_cols(candy_test)\n\nrmse1 &lt;- rmse(predict_test1, truth = winpercent, estimate = .pred)\n\n\nWhich model would you choose based on RMSE on the testing data? Briefly explain your choice.\n\n\n\nExercise 10\n\nUse the model you selected in Exercise 9 to describe what generally makes a good candy, i.e., one with a high win percentage."

Hence, data on 480 patients were used to build a model, whereas data on 253 patients were used to validate the model.”\n“…cross-validation was used with 20 subgroups, so that at most 5% of the data under consideration was excluded at any one time. By employing cross-validation, the possibility of an unusually positive or negative validation subset could be assessed.”\nAngulo, Paul, et al. “The NAFLD fibrosis score: a noninvasive system that identifies liver fibrosis in patients with NAFLD.” Hepatology 45.4 (2007): 846-854."

However your document should include all your code such that if I re-knit your Qmd file I should be able to obtain the results you presented.\n\nException: If you want to highlight something specific about a piece of code, you’re welcome to show that portion.\n\nMerge conflicts will happen, issues will arise, and that’s fine! Commit and push often, and ask questions when stuck.\nMake sure each team member is contributing, both in terms of quality and quantity of contribution (we will be reviewing commits from different team members).\nAll team members are expected to contribute equally to the completion of this assignment and group assessments will be given at its completion - anyone judged to not have sufficient contributed to the final product will have their grade penalized. While different teams members may have different backgrounds and abilities, it is the responsibility of every team member to understand how and why all code and approaches in the assignment works.\n\n\n\nFormatting + communication tips\n\nSuppress Code, Warnings, & Messages\n\nInclude the following code in a code chunk at the top of your .qmd file to suppress all code, warnings, and other messages. Use the code chunk header {r set-up, include = FALSE} to suppress this set up code.\n\nknitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE,\n                      warning = FALSE, \n                      message = FALSE)\n\nAn alternative approach is to add the following code to the YAML:\n\nexecute:\n  echo: false\n  warning: false\n  message: false\n\n\n\n\nHeaders\n\nUse headers to clearly label each section. Make sure there is a space between the last # and the title, so the header renders correctly. For example, ###Section Title will not render as header, but ### Section Title will.\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nInclude all references in a section called “References” at the end of the report.\nThis course does not have specific requirements for formatting citations and references.\n\n\n\nAppendix\n\nIf you have additional work that does not fit or does not belong in the body of the report, you may put it at the end of the document in section called “Appendix”.\nThe items in the appendix should be properly labeled.\nThe appendix should only be for additional material. The reader should be able to fully understand your report without viewing content in the appendix.\n\n\n\nResize figures\n\nResize plots and figures, so you have more space for the narrative.\n\nResize individual figures: Use the code chunk header {r plot1, fig.height = 3, fig.width = 5}, replacing plot1 with a meaningful label and the height and width with values appropriate for your write up.\nResize all figures: Include the fig_width and fig_height options in your YAML header as shown below:\n\n\n\n---\ntitle: \"Your Title\"\nauthor: \"Team Name + Group Members\"\noutput: \n  pdf_document:\n    fig_width: 5\n    fig_height: 3\n---\nReplace the height and width values with values appropriate for your write up.\n\n\nArranging plots\nArrange plots in a grid, instead of one after the other. This is especially useful when displaying plots for exploratory data analysis and to check assumptions.\n\nIf you’re using ggplot2 functions, the patchwork package makes it easy to arrange plots in a grid. See the documentation and examples here.\nIf you’re using base R function, i.e. when using the emplogit functions, put the code par(mfrow = c(rows,columns)) before the code to make the plots. For example, par(mfrow = c(2,3)) will arrange plots in a grid with 2 rows and 3 columns.\n\n\n\nPlot titles and axis labels\nBe sure all plot titles and axis labels are visible and easy to read.\n\nUse informative titles, not variable names, for titles and axis labels.\nUse coord_flip() to flip the x and y axes on the plot. This is useful if you a bar plot with an x-axis that is difficult to read due to overlapping text.\n\n❌ NO! The x-axis is hard to read because the names overlap.\n\nggplot(data = mpg, aes(x = manufacturer)) +\n  geom_bar()\n\n\n\n\n✅ YES! Names are readable\n\nggplot(data = mpg, aes(x = manufacturer)) +\n  geom_bar() +\n  coord_flip()\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo a little more to make the plot look professional!\n\nInformative title and axis labels\nFlipped coordinates to make names readable\nArranged bars based on count\nCapitalized manufacturer names\nOptional: Added color - Use a coordinated color scheme throughout paper / presentation\nOptional: Applied a theme - Use same theme throughout paper / presentation\n\n\nmpg |&gt;\n  count(manufacturer) |&gt;\n  mutate(manufacturer = str_to_title(manufacturer)) |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = fct_reorder(manufacturer,n), y = n)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", fill = \"steelblue\") +\n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(x = \"Manufacturer\", \n       y = \"Count\", \n       title = \"The most common manufacturer is Dodge\") +\n  theme_bw() \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTables and model output\n\nUse the kable function from the knitr package to neatly output all tables and model output. This will also ensure all model coefficients are displayed.\n\nUse the digits argument to display only 3 or 4 significant digits.\nUse the caption argument to add captions to your table.\n\n\n\nmodel &lt;- lm(mpg ~ hp, data = mtcars)\ntidy(model) |&gt;\n  kable(digits = 3)\n\n\n\n\nterm\nestimate\nstd.error\nstatistic\np.value\n\n\n\n\n(Intercept)\n30.099\n1.634\n18.421\n0\n\n\nhp\n-0.068\n0.010\n-6.742\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGuidelines for communicating results\n\nDon’t use variable names in your narrative! Use descriptive terms, so the reader understands your narrative without relying on the data dictionary.\n\n❌ There is a negative linear relationship between mpg and hp.\n✅ There is a negative linear relationship between a car’s fuel economy (in miles per gallon) and its horsepower.\n\nKnow your audience: Your report should be written for a general audience who has an understanding of statistics at the level of STA 210.\nAvoid subject matter jargon: Don’t assume the audience knows all of the specific terminology related to your subject area. If you must use jargon, include a brief definition the first time you introduce a term.\nTell the “so what”: Your report and presentation should be more than a list of interpretations and technical definitions. Focus on what the results mean, i.e. what you want the audience to know about your topic after reading your report or viewing your presentation.\n\n❌ For every one unit increase in horsepower, we expect the miles per gallon to decrease by 0.068 units, on average.\n✅ If the priority is to have good fuel economy, then one should choose a car with lower horsepower. Based on our model, the fuel economy is expected to decrease, on average, by 0.68 miles per gallon for every 10 additional horsepower.\n\nTell a story: All visualizations, tables, model output, and narrative should tell a cohesive story!\nUse one voice: Though multiple people are writing the report, it should read as if it’s from a single author. At least one team member should read through the report before submission to ensure it reads like a cohesive document.\n\n\n\n\nAdditional resources\n\nExploring RStudio’s Visual Markdown Editor\nR for Data Science\nQuarto documentation:\n\nQuarto PDF Basics\nPresentations in Quarto\n\nData visualization\n\nggplot2 Reference\nggplot2: Elegant Graphics for Data Analysis\nData Visualization: A Practice Introduction\nPatchwork R Package"
