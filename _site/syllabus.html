<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="inclusive-community">Inclusive community</h3>
<p>It is my intent that students from all diverse backgrounds and perspectives be well-served by this course, that students’ learning needs be addressed both in and out of class, and that the diversity that the students bring to this class be viewed as a resource, strength, and benefit. It is my intent to present materials and activities that are respectful of diversity and in alignment with <a href="https://provost.duke.edu/initiatives/commitment-to-diversity-and-inclusion">Duke’s Commitment to Diversity and Inclusion</a>. Your suggestions are encouraged and appreciated. Please let me know ways to improve the effectiveness of the course for you personally, or for other students or student groups.</p>
<p>Furthermore, I would like to create a learning environment for my students that supports a diversity of thoughts, perspectives and experiences, and honors your identities. To help accomplish this:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you feel like your performance in the class is being impacted by your experiences outside of class, please don’t hesitate to come and talk with me. If you prefer to speak with someone outside of the course, your academic dean is an excellent resource.</li>
<li>I (like many people) am still in the process of learning about diverse perspectives and identities. If something was said in class (by anyone) that made you feel uncomfortable, please let me or a member of the teaching team know.</li>

<section id="lectures-and-labs" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="lectures-and-labs">Lectures and labs</h2>
<p>Lectures and labs are designed to be interactive, so you gain experience applying new concepts and learning from each other. My role as instructor is to introduce you to new methods, tools, and techniques, but it is up to you to take them and make use of them. A lot of what you do in this course will involve writing code, and coding is a skill that is best learned by doing. Therefore, as much as possible, you will be working on a variety of tasks and activities throughout each lecture and lab. You are expected to prepare for class by completing assigned readings, attend all lecture and lab sessions, and meaningfully contribute to in-class exercises and discussion. Additionally, some lectures will feature application exercises that will be graded based on completing what we do in class.</p>
<p>You are expected to bring a laptop, tablet, or Chromebook to each class so that you can participate in the in-class exercises. Please make sure your device is fully charged before you come to class, as the number of outlets in the classroom will not be sufficient to accommodate everyone.</p>
</section>
<section id="teams" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="teams">Teams</h2>
<p>You will be assigned to a team at the beginning of the semester. You are encouraged to sit with your teammates in lecture and you will also work with them in the lab sessions. All team members are expected to contribute equally to the completion of the labs and project, and you will be asked to evaluate your team members throughout the semester. Failure to adequately contribute to an assignment will result in a penalty to your mark relative to the team’s overall mark.</p>
<p>You are expected to make use of the provided GitHub repository as the central collaborative platform. Commits to this repository will be used as a metric (one of several) of each team member’s relative contribution for each project.</p>
</section>
<section id="activities-assessment" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="activities-assessment">Activities &amp; Assessment</h2>
<p>You will be assessed based on six components: application exercises, homework, labs, exams, project, and teamwork.</p>
<section id="application-exercises" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="application-exercises">Application Exercises</h3>
<p>Parts of some lectures will be dedicated to working on Application Exercises (AEs). These exercises which give you an opportunity to practice apply the statistical concepts and code introduced in the prepare assignment. These AEs are due within three days of the corresponding lecture period. Specifically, AEs from Monday lectures are due Thursday by 11:59p ET, and AEs from Wednesday lectures are due Saturday by 11:59p ET.</p>
<p>Because these AEs are for practice, they will be graded based on making a good-faith effort in attempting all questions covered in class. You are welcome to, but not required, to work on AEs beyond lecture. Successful on-time effort on at least 80% of AEs will result in full credit for AEs in the final course grade. Because AEs are intended for in-class activities, there are no extensions given on AEs.</p>
</section>
<section id="labs" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="labs">Labs</h3>
<p>In labs, you will apply the concepts discussed in lecture to various data analysis scenarios, with a focus on the computation and communication. Most lab assignments will be completed in teams, and all team members are expected to contribute equally to the completion of each assignment. You are expected to use the team’s Git repository on the course’s GitHub page as the central platform for collaboration. Commits to this repository will be used as a metric of each team member’s relative contribution for each lab, and there will be periodic peer evaluation on the team collaboration. Lab assignments will be completed using Quarto, correspond to an appropriate GitHub repository, and submitted for grading in Gradescope.</p>
<p><em>The lowest lab grade will be dropped at the end of the semester.</em></p>
</section>
<section id="homework" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="homework">Homework</h3>
<p>In homework, you will apply what you’ve learned during lecture and lab to complete data analysis tasks. You may discuss homework assignments with other students; however, homework should be completed and submitted individually. Similar to lab assignments, homework must be typed up using Quarto and GitHub and submitted as a PDF in Gradescope.</p>
<p>One homework assignment will be dedicated to a <em>statistics experience</em>. The statistics experience is an opportunity to engage with statistics and data science outside of the classroom through podcasts, books, seminars, data analysis competitions, and other activities. As you complete these experiences, the goal is to consider how the material you’re learning in the course connects with society more broadly.</p>
<p><em>The lowest homework grade will be dropped at the end of the semester.</em></p>
</section>
<section id="exams" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="exams">Exams</h3>
<p>There will be two exams in this course. Each exam will include a closed-notes in-class component and an open-note take-home component. Through these exams you have the opportunity to demonstrate what you’ve learned in the course thus far. The exams will focus on both conceptual understanding of the content and application through analysis and computational tasks. The content of the exam will be related to the content in reading assignments, lectures, application exercises, homework, and lab assignments. More detail about the exams will be given during the semester.</p>
</section>
<section id="project" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="project">Project</h3>
<p>The purpose of the <a href="./project/">final project</a> is to apply what you’ve learned throughout the semester to analyze an interesting data-driven research question. The project will be completed with your lab teams, and each team will present their work through a written report and presentation. More information about the project will be provided during the semester.</p>

<section id="five-tips-for-success" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="five-tips-for-success">Five tips for success</h2>
<p>Your success on this course depends very much on you and the effort you put into it. The course has been organized so that the burden of learning is on you. Your TAs and I will help you be providing you with materials and answering questions and setting a pace, but for this to work you must do the following:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Complete all the preparation work before class.</p></li>
<li><p>Ask questions. As often as you can. In class, out of class. Ask me, ask the TAs, ask your friends, ask the person sitting next to you. This will help you more than anything else. If you get a question wrong on an assessment, ask us why. If you’re not sure about the homework, ask. If you hear something on the news that sounds related to what we discussed, ask. If the reading is confusing, ask.</p></li>
<li><p>Do the readings.</p></li>
<li><p>Do the homework and lab.The earlier you start, the better. It’s not enough to just mechanically plow through the exercises. You should ask yourself how these exercises relate to earlier material, and imagine how they might be changed (to make questions for an exam, for example.)</p></li>
<li><p>Don’t procrastinate. The content builds upon what was taught in previous weeks, so if something is confusing to you in Week 2, Week 3 will become more confusing, Week 4 even worse, etc. Don’t let the week end with unanswered questions. But if you find yourself falling behind and not knowing where to begin asking, come to office hours and work with a member of the teaching team to help you identify a good (re)starting point.</p></li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="academic-honesty">Academic honesty</h3>
<p><strong>TL;DR: Don’t cheat!</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Only work that is clearly assigned as team work should be completed collaboratively.</li>
</ul>
<!-- -->
<ul>
<li><p>The homework assignments must be completed individually and you are welcomed to discuss the assignment with classmates at a high level (e.g., discuss what’s the best way for approaching a problem, what functions are useful for accomplishing a particular task, etc.). However you may not directly share answers to homework questions (including any code) with anyone other than myself and the teaching assistants.</p></li>
<li><p>You may not discuss or otherwise work with others on the exams. Unauthorized collaboration or using unauthorized materials will be considered a violation for all students involved. More details will be given closer to the exam date.</p></li>
<li><p>For the projects and team labs, collaboration within teams is not only allowed, but expected. Communication between teams at a high level is also allowed however you may not share code or components of the project or team labs across teams.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Reusing code</strong>: Unless explicitly stated otherwise, you may make use of online resources (e.g.&nbsp;StackOverflow) for coding examples on assignments. If you directly use code from an outside source (or use it as inspiration), you must explicitly cite where you obtained the code. Any recycled code that is discovered and is not explicitly cited will be treated as plagiarism.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Use of artificial intelligence (AI)</strong>: You should treat AI tools, such as ChatGPT, the same as other online resources. There are two guiding principles that govern how you can use AI in this course:<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> (1) <em>Cognitive dimension:</em> Working with AI should not reduce your ability to think clearly. We will practice using AI to facilitate—rather than hinder—learning. (2) <em>Ethical dimension</em><strong>:</strong> Students using AI should be transparent about their use and make sure it aligns with academic integrity.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>AI tools for code:</strong> You may make use of the technology for coding examples on assignments; if you do so, you must explicitly cite where you obtained the code. Any recycled code that is discovered and is not explicitly cited will be treated as plagiarism. You may use <a href="https://guides.lib.monash.edu/c.php?g=219786&amp;p=6972087">these guidelines</a> for citing AI-generated content.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>No AI tools for narrative:</strong> Unless instructed otherwise, AI is <u><strong>not</strong></u> permitted for writing narrative on assignments. In general, you may use AI as a resource as you complete assignments but not to answer the exercises for you. You are ultimately responsible for the work you turn in; it should reflect your understanding of the course content.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>If you are unsure if the use of a particular resource complies with the academic honesty policy, please ask a member of the teaching team.</p>
<p>Regardless of course delivery format, it is the responsibility of all students to understand and follow all Duke policies, including academic integrity (e.g., completing one’s own work, following proper citation of sources, adhering to guidance around group work projects,and more).Ignoring these requirements is a violation of the Duke Community Standard. Any questions and/or concerns regarding academic integrity can be directed to the Office of Student Conduct and Community Standards at <a href="mailto:conduct@duke.edu">conduct@duke.edu</a>.</p>
