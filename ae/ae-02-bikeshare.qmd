## Data

Our dataset contains daily rentals from the Capital Bikeshare in Washington, DC in 2011 and 2012. It was obtained from the `dcbikeshare` data set in the dsbox R package.

We will focus on the following variables in the analysis:

-   `count`: total bike rentals
-   `temp_orig`: Temperature in degrees Celsius
-   `season`: 1 - winter, 2 - spring, 3 - summer, 4 - fall

Click [here](https://rstudio-education.github.io/dsbox/reference/dcbikeshare.html) for the full list of variables and definitions.

```{r load-data}
#| message: false
bikeshare <- read_csv("data/dcbikeshare.csv")
```

## Daily counts and temperature

### Exercise 1

Visualize the distribution of daily bike rentals and temperature as well as the relationship between these two variables.

```{r bike-temp-viz}
#| warning: false
#| message: false

p1 <- ggplot(bikeshare, aes(x = count)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 250) + 
  labs(x = "Daily bike rentals")

p2 <- ggplot(bikeshare, aes(x = temp_orig)) +
  geom_histogram() + 
  labs(x = "Temperature (Celsius)")

p3 <- ggplot(bikeshare, aes(y = count, x = temp_orig)) +
  geom_point() + 
  labs(x = "Temperature (Celsius)", 
       y = "Daily bike rentals")

(p1 | p2) / p3
```

### Exercise 2

Describe the relationship between daily bike rentals and temperature. Comment on how we expect the number of bike rentals to change as the temperature increases.

### Exercise 3

Suppose you want to fit a model so you can use the temperature to predict the number of bike rentals. Would a model of the form

$$\text{count} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 ~ \text{temp\_orig} + \epsilon$$

be an appropriate fit for the data? Why or why not?
