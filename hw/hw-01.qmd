# Instructions

-   Write all narrative using full sentences. Write all interpretations and conclusions in the context of the data.
-   Be sure all analysis code is displayed in the rendered pdf.
-   If you are fitting a model, display the model output in a neatly formatted table. (The `tidy` and `kable` functions can help!)
-   If you are creating a plot, use clear and informative labels and titles.
-   Render, commit, and push your work to GitHub regularly, at least after each exercise. Write short and informative commit messages.
-   When youâ€™re done, we should be able to render the final version of the Quarto document in your GitHub repo to fully reproduce your pdf.

# Exercises[^1]

[^1]: Exercises 1 - 4 are adapted from exercises in Section 1.8 of @roback2021beyond.

## Exercise 1

<!--Adapted from BMLR Ch 1 Ex 1-->

Consider the following scenario:

> Researchers record the number of cricket chirps per minute and temperature during that time. They use linear regression to investigate whether the number of chirps varies with temperature.

a.  Identify the response and predictor variable.

b.  Write the complete specification of the statistical model.

c.  Write the assumptions for linear regression in the context of the problem.

## Exercise 2

<!--Adapted from BMLR Ch 1 Ex 2-->

Consider the following scenario:

> A randomized clinical trial investigated postnatal depression and the use of an estrogen patch. Patients were randomly assigned to either use the patch or not. Depression scores were recorded on 6 different visits.

a.  Identify the response and predictor variables.

b.  Identify which model assumption(s) are violated. Briefly explain your choice.

## Exercise 3

<!--Adapted from Ch 1 Ex 3-->

Use the [Kentucky Derby case study](https://bookdown.org/roback/bookdown-BeyondMLR/ch-MLRreview.html#review-of-multiple-linear-regression) in Chapter 1 of *Beyond Multiple Linear Regression.*

a.  Consider [Equation (1.3)](https://bookdown.org/roback/bookdown-BeyondMLR/ch-MLRreview.html#multiple-linear-regression-with-two-predictors) in Section 1.6.3. Show why we have to be sure to say "holding year constant", "after adjusting for year", or an equivalent statement, when interpreting $\beta_2$.
b.  Briefly explain why there is no error (random variation) term $\epsilon_i$ in [Equation (1.4)](https://bookdown.org/roback/bookdown-BeyondMLR/ch-MLRreview.html#multiple-linear-regression-with-an-interaction-term) in Section 1.6.6?

## Exercise 4

<!--Adapted from Ch 1 Guided Ex 3-->

The data set `kingCountyHouses.csv` in the `data` folder contains data on over 20,000 houses sold in King County, Washington (@kingcounty).

We will use the following variables:

-   `price` = selling price of the house
-   `sqft` = interior square footage

*See Section 1.8 of Beyond Multiple Linear Regression for the full list of variables.*

a.  Fit a linear regression model with `price` as the response variable and `sqft` as the predictor variable (Model 1). Interpret the slope coefficient in terms of the expected change in price when `sqft` increases by 100.

b.  Fit Model 2, where `logprice` (the natural log of price) is now the response variable and `sqft` is still the predictor variable. How is the `logprice` expected to change when `sqft` increases by 100?

c.  Recall that $log(a) - log(b) = log(\frac{a}{b})$. Use this to derive how the `price` is expected to change when `sqft` increases by 100 based on Model 2.

d.  Fit Model 3, where `price` and `logsqft` (the natural log of sqft) are the response and predictor variables, respectively. How is the price expected to change when sqft increases by 10%? *As a hint, this is the same as multiplying sqft by 1.10.*

## Exercise 5

The goal of this analysis is to use characteristics of 593 colleges and universities in the United States to understand variability in the early career pay, defined as the median salary for alumni with 0 - 5 years of experience. The data was obtained from [TidyTuesday College tuition, diversity, and pay](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2020/2020-03-10/readme.md), and was originaly collected from the [PayScale College Salary Report](https://www.payscale.com/college-salary-report/bachelors).

The data set is located in `college-data.csv` in the `data` folder. We will focus on the following variables:

| variable           | class     | description                                                                           |
|:------------|:------------|:---------------------------------------------|
| name               | character | Name of school                                                                        |
| state_name         | character | state name                                                                            |
| type               | character | Public or private                                                                     |
| early_career_pay   | double    | Median salary for alumni with 0 - 5 years experience (in US dollars)                  |
| stem_percent       | double    | Percent of degrees awarded in science, technology, engineering, or math subjects      |
| out_of_state_total | double    | Total cost for in-state residents in USD (sum of room & board + out of state tuition) |

a.  Visualize the distribution of the response variable `early_career_pay`. Write 1 - 2 observations from the plot.
b.  Visualize the relationship between (i) `early_career_pay` and `type` and (ii) `early_career_pay` and `stem_percent`. Write an observation from each plot.
c.  Below is the specification of the statistical model for this analysis. Fit the model and neatly display the results using 3 digits. Display the 95% confidence interval for the coefficients.

$$
\begin{align}
early\_career\_pay_{i} = \beta_0 &+ \beta_1~out\_of\_state\_total_{i} \\ &+ \beta_2 ~ type_i\\&+ \beta_3 ~ stem\_percent_{i}\\ &+ \beta_4 ~ type_i * stem\_percent_{i} \\ &+ \epsilon_{i}, \hspace{5mm} \text{where } \epsilon_i \sim N(0, \sigma^2)
\end{align}
$$

d.  How many degrees of freedom are there in the estimate of the regression standard error $\sigma$ for the model from part c?
e.  What is the 95% confidence interval for the amount in which the intercept for public institutions differs from private institutions?

## Exercise 6

Use the analysis from the previous exercise to write a paragraph (\~ 3 - 5 sentences) describing the differences in early career pay based on the institution characteristics. *The summary should be consistent with the results from the previous exercise, comprehensive, answers the primary analysis question, and tells a cohesive story (e.g., a list of interpretations will not receive full credit).*

# Submission

To submit the assignment, push your final changes to your GitHub repo. Then, you're done! We will grade the latest versions of the files that were pushed to the GitHub repo by the deadline unless otherwise notified that you wish to submit late work.

# Grading

| **Total**             | **50** |
|-----------------------|:------:|
| Ex 1                  |   8    |
| Ex 2                  |   4    |
| Ex 3                  |   7    |
| Ex 4                  |   12   |
| Ex 5                  |   12   |
| Ex 6                  |   4    |
| Workflow & formatting |   3    |

The "Workflow & formatting" grade is to based on the organization of the assignment write up along with the reproducible workflow. This includes having an organized write up with neat and readable headers, code, and narrative, including properly rendered mathematical notation. It also includes having a reproducible Quarto document that can be rendered to reproduce the submitted PDF, along with implementing version control using multiple commits with informative commit messages.
