## Generalized Linear Models

*In statistics, a generalized linear model (GLM) is a flexible generalization of ordinary linear regression. The GLM generalizes linear regression by allowing the linear model to be related to the response variable via a link function and by allowing the magnitude of the variance of each measurement to be a function of its predicted value.*[^1]

[^1]: [Generalized linear model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_linear_model)

. . .

**Example: Logistic regression**

$$\begin{aligned}\pi = P(y = 1 | x) \hspace{2mm} &\Rightarrow \hspace{2mm} \text{Link function: } \log\big(\frac{\pi}{1-\pi}\big) \\
&\Rightarrow \log\big(\frac{\pi}{1-\pi}\big) = \beta_0 + \beta_1~x\end{aligned}$$

    >
    > -   I will act if the Standard is compromised.

<br>

-   Commit to respect, honor, and celebrate our diverse community

-   Commit to being part of a learning environment that is welcoming and accessible to everyone

## Accessibility

-   The [Student Disability Access Office (SDAO)](https://access.duke.edu/students) is available to ensure that students are able to engage with their courses and related assignments.

-   If you have documented accommodations from SDAO, please send the documentation as soon as possible.

-   I am committed to making all course activities and materials accessible. If any course component is not accessible to you in any way, please don’t hesitate to let me know.

## Support {.midi}

-   **Office hours** to meet with a member of the teaching team.

    -   Find the schedule in the syllabus and [course webpage](https://sta310-sp24.netlify.app/course-overview)
    -   Office hours begin January 16
    -   Please email me if you'd like to meet before then

-   **Slack** for questions about course logistics, content, and assignments

-   **Email** for questions not appropriate for Slack, e.g., regarding personal matters or grades

    -   Please put **STA 310** in the subject line

See the [syllabus](https://sta310-sp24.netlify.app/syllabus/#additional-support) and [support](https://sta310-sp24.netlify.app/support) page for additional academic and mental health and wellness resources

# Course policies

## COVID-19 and other illness

-   Please do not come to class if you have tested positive for COVID-19, have possible symptoms and have not yet been tested, or have other illness.

-   Read and follow the university guidelines regarding COVID-19 at [coronavirus.duke.edu](https://coronavirus.duke.edu/).

## Late work {.midi}

-   Homework will be accepted up to 48 hours after the deadline. There will be a 5% deduction for each 24-hour period the assignment is late.

-   No late work is accepted on quizzes, and there are no makeups for missed quizzes.

-   Late policy for projects:

    -   **Presentation:** Late presentations are not accepted and there are no make ups for missed presentations.

    -   **Write up:** There will be a 5% deduction for write ups submitted late but the same day, a 10% deduction for write ups submitted the next day, and a 15% deduction for write ups submitted two days late (by 11:59pm). No credit given for write ups submitted more than 2 days after the deadline.

    -   **Peer evaluation:** No late work is accepted on peer evaluations.

## Academic integrity and collaboration {.midi}

-   The homework assignments must be completed individually and you are welcomed to discuss the assignment with classmates at a high level.
-   You may not discuss or otherwise work with others on quizzes.
-   For the projects collaboration within teams is not only allowed, but expected. Communication between teams at a high level is also allowed however you may not share code or components of the project across teams.
-   **Reusing code**: Unless explicitly stated otherwise, you may make use of online resources (e.g. StackOverflow) for coding examples on assignments. If you directly use code from an outside source (or use it as inspiration), you must explicitly cite where you obtained the code.

## Use of artificial intelligence (AI)

-   You should treat AI tools, such as ChatGPT, the same as other online resources.

-   There are two guiding principles that govern how you can use AI in this course:[^2]

    -   \(1\) *Cognitive dimension:* Working with AI should not reduce your ability to think clearly. We will practice using AI to facilitate—rather than hinder—learning.

    -   \(2\) *Ethical dimension***:** Students using AI should be transparent about their use and make sure it aligns with academic integrity.

[^2]: These guiding principles are based on [*Course Policies related to ChatGPT and other AI Tools*](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WpCeTyiWCPQ9MNCsFeKMDQLSTsg1oKfNIH6MzoSFXqQ/preview) developed by Joel Gladd, Ph.D.[↩︎](https://sta101-f23.github.io/course-syllabus.html#fnref1)

## Use of artificial intelligence (AI)

✅ **AI tools for code:** You may make use of the technology for coding examples on assignments; if you do so, you must explicitly cite where you obtained the code.

❌ **No AI tools for narrative:** Unless instructed otherwise, AI is [**not**]{.underline} permitted for writing narrative on assignments.

::: callout-important
In general, you may use AI as a resource as you complete assignments but not to answer the exercises for you. You are ultimately responsible for the work you turn in; it should reflect your understanding of the course content.
