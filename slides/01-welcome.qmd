## Generalized Linear Models

*In statistics, a generalized linear model (GLM) is a flexible generalization of ordinary linear regression. The GLM generalizes linear regression by allowing the linear model to be related to the response variable via a link function and by allowing the magnitude of the variance of each measurement to be a function of its predicted value.*[^1]

[^1]: Souce: [Generalized linear model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_linear_model)

. . .

**Example: Logistic regression**

$$\begin{aligned}\pi = P(y = 1 | x) \hspace{2mm} &\Rightarrow \hspace{2mm} \text{Link function: } \log\big(\frac{\pi}{1-\pi}\big) \\
&\Rightarrow \log\big(\frac{\pi}{1-\pi}\big) = \beta_0 + \beta_1~x\end{aligned}$$

## Course learning objectives {.midi}

By the end of the semester, you will be able to ...

::: incremental
-   describe generalized linear models (GLMs) as a unified framework.
-   explain how specific models fit into the GLM framework, including extensions for correlated data.
-   identify the appropriate model given the data and analysis objective.
-   analyze real-world data by fitting and interpreting GLMs.
-   use R for analysis, Quarto to write reports, git for version control, and GitHub for collaboration.
-   effectively communicate results from statistical analyses to a general audience in writing and oral presentations.
:::

## Course topics

**Generalized Linear Models**

-   Introduce models for non-normal response variables
-   Estimation, interpretation, and inference
-   Mathematical details of GLMs as a unified framework

. . .

**Modeling correlated data**

-   Introduce multilevel models for correlated and longitudinal data

-   Estimation, interpretation, and inference

-   Mathematical details, particularly diving into covariance structures

## GLMs in practice {.small}

*"...we used **negative binomial regression** to model the association between the number of questions produced, race, and group after adjusting for the additional covariates age and years of education. **Poisson and zero-inflated Poisson regression models** were also considered...the negative binomial model was a good fit for the data given the **overdispersion** in the distribution of number of questions asked."*[^2]

*" ...a **logistic regression model** is used to test how the likelihood of a foul is affected by which team is the home team, the foul differential, and the score differential...The logistic regression was run under several specifications ... using **clustered observation standard errors**, with each game as a cluster. This is done as an attempt to adjust for the fact that **observations may not be independent** as required under the logistic specification.*[^3]

# Course policies

## COVID-19 and other illness

-   Please do not come to class if you have tested positive for COVID-19, have possible symptoms and have not yet been tested, or have other illness.

-   Read and follow the university guidelines regarding COVID-19 at [coronavirus.duke.edu](https://coronavirus.duke.edu/).

## Late work {.midi}

-   Homework will be accepted up to 48 hours after the deadline. There will be a 5% deduction for each 24-hour period the assignment is late.

-   No late work is accepted on quizzes, and there are no makeups for missed quizzes.

-   Late policy for projects:

    -   **Presentation:** Late presentations are not accepted and there are no make ups for missed presentations.

    -   **Write up:** There will be a 5% deduction for write ups submitted late but the same day, a 10% deduction for write ups submitted the next day, and a 15% deduction for write ups submitted two days late (by 11:59pm). No credit given for write ups submitted more than 2 days after the deadline.

    -   **Peer evaluation:** No late work is accepted on peer evaluations.

## Academic integrity and collaboration {.midi}

-   The homework assignments must be completed individually and you are welcomed to discuss the assignment with classmates at a high level.
-   You may not discuss or otherwise work with others on quizzes.
-   For the projects collaboration within teams is not only allowed, but expected. Communication between teams at a high level is also allowed however you may not share code or components of the project across teams.
-   **Reusing code**: Unless explicitly stated otherwise, you may make use of online resources (e.g. StackOverflow) for coding examples on assignments. If you directly use code from an outside source (or use it as inspiration), you must explicitly cite where you obtained the code.

## Use of artificial intelligence (AI) {.midi}

-   You should treat AI tools, such as ChatGPT, the same as other online resources.

-   There are two guiding principles that govern how you can use AI in this course:[^4]

    -   \(1\) *Cognitive dimension:* Working with AI should not reduce your ability to think clearly. We will practice using AI to facilitate—rather than hinder—learning.

    -   \(2\) *Ethical dimension***:** Students using AI should be transparent about their use and make sure it aligns with academic integrity.

[^4]: These guiding principles are based on [*Course Policies related to ChatGPT and other AI Tools*](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WpCeTyiWCPQ9MNCsFeKMDQLSTsg1oKfNIH6MzoSFXqQ/preview) developed by Joel Gladd, Ph.D.[↩︎](https://sta101-f23.github.io/course-syllabus.html#fnref1)

## Use of artificial intelligence (AI)

✅ **AI tools for code:** You may make use of the technology for coding examples on assignments; if you do so, you must explicitly cite where you obtained the code.

❌ **No AI tools for narrative:** Unless instructed otherwise, AI is [**not**]{.underline} permitted for writing narrative on assignments.

<br>

::: callout-important
In general, you may use AI as a resource as you complete assignments but not to answer the exercises for you. You are ultimately responsible for the work you turn in; it should reflect your understanding of the course content.
