# Reproducibility

## Reproducibility checklist

::: question
What does it mean for an analysis to be reproducible?
:::

. . .

**Near term goals**:

‚úîÔ∏è Can the tables and figures be exactly reproduced from the code and data?

‚úîÔ∏è Does the code actually do what you think it does?

‚úîÔ∏è In addition to what was done, is it clear *why* it was done?

. . .

**Long term goals**:

‚úîÔ∏è Can the code be used for other data?

‚úîÔ∏è Can you extend the code to do other things?

## Why is reproducibility important?

-   Results produced are more reliable and trustworthy [@ostblom2022]

-   Facilitates more effective collaboration [@ostblom2022]

-   Contributing to science, which builds and organizes knowledge in terms of testable hypotheses [@alexander2023]

-   Possible to identify and correct errors or biases in the analysis process [@alexander2023]

## Toolkit

-   **Scriptability** $\rightarrow$ R

-   **Literate programming** (code, narrative, output in one place) $\rightarrow$ Quarto

-   **Version control** $\rightarrow$ Git / GitHub

::: callout-note
You will start using these computing tools in Lab 01.
:::

## R and RStudio

-   R is a statistical programming language

-   RStudio is a convenient interface for R (an integrated development environment, IDE)

![Source: [Statistical Inference via Data Science](https://moderndive.com/1-getting-started.html)](images/03/r_vs_rstudio_1.png){fig-align="center"}

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## RStudio IDE

![](images/02/rstudio-panes.png){fig-align="center"}

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Quarto

-   Fully reproducible reports -- the analysis is run from the beginning each time you render

-   Code goes in chunks and narrative goes outside of chunks

-   Visual editor to make document editing experience similar to a word processor (Google docs, Word, Pages, etc.)

## Quarto

![](images/03/quarto.png){fig-align="center"}

## How will we use Quarto?

-   Every application exercise and assignment is written in a Quarto document

-   You'll have a template Quarto document to start with

-   The amount of scaffolding in the template will decrease over the semester

## git and GitHub

![](images/02/git-github.png){fig-align="center"}

-   **git** is a version control system -- like "Track Changes" features from Microsoft Word.
-   **GitHub** is the home for your git-based projects on the internet (like DropBox but much better).
-   There are a lot of git commands and very few people know them all. 99% of the time you will use git to add, commit, push, and pull.

# Multivariable relationships

## Carbohydrates in Starbucks food

-   Starbucks often displays the total calories in their food items but not the other nutritional information.

-   Carbohydrates are a body's main fuel source. The Dietary Guidelines for America recommend that carbohydrates make up 45% to 65% of total daily calories.[^1]

-   Our goal is to understand the relationship between the amount of carbohydrates and calories in Starbucks food items. We'd also like to assess if the relationship differs based on the type of food item (bakery, salad, sandwich, etc.)

[^1]: Source: [Mayo Clinic](https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/carbohydrates/art-20045705#:~:text=How%20many%20carbohydrates%20do%20you,grams%20of%20carbs%20a%20day.)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Starbucks data

<!-- change example, or at a minimum change bakery labels to "bakery vs. not bakery" instead of 0 and 1.-->

```{r data, echo  = F}
starbucks <- openintro::starbucks |>
  mutate(bakery = factor(if_else(type == "bakery", 1, 0)))
```

-   **Observations**: 77 Starbucks food items
-   **Variables:**
    -   `carb`: Total carbohydrates (in grams)
    -   `calories`: Total calories
    -   `bakery`: 1: bakery food item, 0: other food type

## Terminology

-   `carb` is the **response variable**
    -   variable whose variation we want to understand / variable we wish to predict
    -   also known as *outcome* or *dependent* variable

. . .

-   `calories`, `bakery` are the **predictor variables**
    -   variables used to account for variation in the response
    -   also known as *explanatory*, *independent*, or *input* variables

## Univariate exploratory data analysis

```{r univariate}
#| echo: false
p1 <- ggplot(data = starbucks, aes(x = carb))  + 
  geom_histogram(fill = "steelblue", color = "black") + 
  labs(x = "Carbohydrates (in grams)", 
       y = "Count")

p2 <- ggplot(data = starbucks, aes(x = calories))  + 
  geom_histogram(fill = "steelblue", color = "black") + 
  labs(x = "Calories", 
       y = "Count") 

p3 <- ggplot(data = starbucks, aes(x = bakery))  + 
  geom_bar(fill = "steelblue", color = "black") + 
  labs(x = "Bakery Item", 
       y = "Count")

p1 + (p2 / p3)
```

## Bivariate exploratory data analysis

```{r bivariate}
#| echo: false
p1 <- ggplot(data = starbucks, aes(x = calories, y = carb)) + 
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, color = "steelblue") +
  labs(x = "Calories", 
      y  = "Carbohydrates (grams)")

p2 <- ggplot(data = starbucks, aes(x = bakery, y = carb)) + 
  geom_boxplot(fill = "steelblue", color = "black") +
  labs(x = "Bakery", 
      y  = "Carbohydrates (grams)")
  
p1 + p2
```

## Function between response and predictors

::: goal
$$\text{carb} = f(\text{calories}, \text{bakery}) + \epsilon$$
:::

-   **Goal**: Determine $f$
-   How do we determine $f$?
    -   Make an assumption about the functional form $f$ (parametric model)
    -   Use the data to fit a model based on that form

## Determine $f$

1)  Choose the functional form of $f$, i.e., **choose the appropriate model given the response variable**

-   Suppose $f$ takes the form of a linear model\
    $$y = f(\mathbf{X}) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \dots + \beta_p x_p + \epsilon$$

. . .

2.  Use the data to fit (or train) the model, i.e, **estimate the model parameters,** $\beta_0, \beta_1, \ldots, \beta_p$

## Carb vs. Calories

```{r echo = F}
ggplot(data = starbucks, aes(x = calories, y = carb)) + 
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, color = "steelblue") +
  labs(x = "Calories", 
      y  = "Carbohydrates (grams)", 
      title = "Total Carbohydrates vs. Calories")
```

$$\text{carb} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 ~\text{calories} + \epsilon$$

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Carb vs. Calories + Bakery

```{r echo = F}
model1 <- lm(carb ~ calories + bakery, data = starbucks)
model1 <- tidy(model1)
```

```{r echo = F}
ggplot(data = starbucks, aes(x = calories, y = carb, color = bakery)) + 
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_abline(slope = model1$estimate[2], intercept = model1$estimate[1], color = "#1B9E77") +
  geom_abline(slope = model1$estimate[2], intercept = model1$estimate[1] + model1$estimate[3], color = "#7570B3") +
  labs(x = "Calories", 
      y  = "Carbohydrates (grams)",
      color = "Bakery", 
      title = "Total Carbohydrates vs. Calories", 
      subtitle = "by Bakery") + 
  scale_color_manual(values=c("#1B9E77", "#7570B3"))
```

$$\text{carb} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 ~\text{calories} + \beta_2 ~\text{bakery} + \epsilon$$

## Carb vs. Calories + Bakery (with interaction)

```{r}
#| echo: false

ggplot(data = starbucks, aes(x = calories, y = carb, color = bakery)) + 
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) +
  labs(x = "Calories", 
      y  = "Carbohydrates (grams)",
      color = "Bakery", 
      title = "Total Carbohydrates vs. Calories", 
      subtitle = "With Interaction") + 
  scale_color_manual(values=c("#1B9E77", "#7570B3"))

```

$${\small \text{carb} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 ~\text{calories} + \beta_2 ~\text{bakery} + \beta_3 ~ \text{calories} \times \text{bakery}  + \epsilon}$$

## Statistical model vs. regression equation {.midi}

**Statistical model (also known as data-generating model)**

$${\small \text{carb} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 ~\text{calories} + \beta_2 ~\text{bakery} + \beta_3 ~ \text{calories} \times \text{bakery}  + \epsilon}$$

Models the process for generating values of the response in the population (function + error)

<br>

. . .

**Regression equation**

Estimate of the function using the sample data

$${\small \hat{\text{carb}} = \hat{\beta}_0 + \hat{\beta}_1 ~\text{calories} + \hat{\beta}_2 ~\text{bakery} + \hat{\beta}_3 ~ \text{calories} \times \text{bakery}}$$

## Why fit a model?

-   **Prediction:** Expected value of the response variable for given values of the predictor variables

-   **Inference:** Conclusion about the relationship between the response and predictor variables

::: question
-   What is an example of a **prediction** question that can be answered using the model of carb vs. calories and bakery?

-   What is an example of an **inference** question that can be answered using the model of carb vs. calories and bakery?

## Recap {.midi}

-   **Reproducibility**

    -   It is best practice conduct all data analysis in a reproducible way

    -   We will implement a reproducible workflow using R, Quarto, and git/GitHub

<!-- -->

-   **Multivariable relationships**

    -   We can use exploratory data analysis to describe the relationship between two variables

    -   We make an assumption about the relationship between variables when doing linear regression

    -   The two main objectives for fitting a linear regression model are (1) prediction and (2) inference
