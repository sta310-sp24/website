### Tulane Health Policy Case Competition {.midi}

*"The Tulane Health Policy Case Competition gives teams of undergraduate students an opportunity to apply their talents and knowledge to put together a solution to a given health policy program Teams of up to three undergraduate students create policy-based solutions to a given problem. A workshop will be provided shortly after the case is released. Teams will construct PowerPoint presentations on solutions to the problem. Finalists will present to a panel of judges for real-time feedback."*

## Statistician of the day {.midi}

**What**: Each week, we will highlight a statisticians, data scientists, or other scholars from groups who have been historically marginalized in the field and whose work has made a significant impact.

**Goal:** Learn about scholars you may not see in traditional textbooks and see the breadth of past and current work in the field.

**Who:** Scholars are from the [CURV (connecting, uplifting, and recognizing voices)](https://hardin47.github.io/CURV/) database started by Dr. Jo Hardin at Pomona College

**Participate:** Present a Statistician of the Day or contribute to the CURV data base as your statistics experience

*Du Bois (1868 - 1963) was a sociologist who contributed to the field of data visualization through infographics related to the African American in the early twentieth century.*

*In 1900 Du Bois contributed approximately 60 data visualizations to an exhibit at the Exposition Universelle in Paris, an exhibit designed to illustrate the progress made by African Americans since the end of slavery (only 37 years prior, in 1863).*

# AE 03 Follow-up

## AE 03 Follow-up {.midi}

**Goal:** Use simple linear regression to model the relationship between temperature and daily bike rentals in the **winter** season

```{r}
#| include: false


winter <- read_csv("../ae/data/dcbikeshare.csv") |>
  mutate(season = case_when(
    season == 1 ~ "winter", 
    season == 2 ~ "spring",

    season == 4 ~ "fall"
  ), 
  season = factor(season)) |>
  filter(season == "winter")

```

## AE 03 Follow-up

**Statistical Model**:

$$count = \beta_0 +\beta_1 ~ temp\_orig + \epsilon, \hspace{5mm} \epsilon \sim N(0, \sigma_{\epsilon}^2)$$

```{r}

## Data: Houses in Duke Forest

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Data on houses that were sold in the Duke Forest neighborhood of Durham, NC around November 2020
-   Scraped from Zillow
-   Source: [`openintro::duke_forest`](http://openintrostat.github.io/openintro/reference/duke_forest.html)
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
![](images/05/duke_forest_home.jpg){fig-alt="Home in Duke Forest"}
:::
:::

**Goal**: Use the area (in square feet) to understand variability in the price of houses in Duke Forest.

## Exploratory data analysis

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
ggplot(duke_forest, aes(x = area, y = price)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.7) +
  labs(
    x = "Area (square feet)",
    y = "Sale price (USD)",
    title = "Price and area of houses in Duke Forest"
  ) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = label_dollar()) 
```

## Modeling {.midi}

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: "|5|6"

df_fit <- linear_reg() |>
  #set_engine("lm") |>
  fit(price ~ area, data = duke_forest)

tidy(df_fit) |>
  kable(digits = 2) #neatly format table to 2 digits
```

. . .

<br>

```{r}
#| echo: false
intercept <- tidy(df_fit) |> filter(term == "(Intercept)") |> pull(estimate) |> round()
slope <- tidy(df_fit) |> filter(term == "area") |> pull(estimate) |> round()
```

-   **Intercept:** Duke Forest houses that are 0 square feet are expected to sell, for `r dollar(intercept)`, on average.
    -   Is this interpretation useful?
-   **Slope:** For each additional square foot, we expect the sale price of Duke Forest houses to be higher by `r dollar(slope)`, on average.

## From sample to population {.midi}

> For each additional square foot, we expect the sale price of Duke Forest houses to be higher by `r dollar(slope)`, on average.

<br>

-   This estimate is valid for the single sample of `r nrow(duke_forest)` houses.
-   But what if we're not interested quantifying the relationship between the size and price of a house in this single sample?
-   What if we want to say something about the relationship between these variables for all houses in Duke Forest?

## Statistical inference

-   **Statistical inference** provide methods and tools so we can use the single observed sample to make valid statements (inferences) about the population it comes from

-   For our inferences to be valid, the sample should be random and representative of the population we're interested in

## Inference for simple linear regression

-   Calculate a confidence interval for the slope, $\beta_1$

-   Conduct a hypothesis test for the slope,$\beta_1$

# Confidence interval for the slope

## Confidence interval {.midi}

::: incremental
-   A plausible range of values for a population parameter is called a **confidence interval**
-   Using only a single point estimate is like fishing in a murky lake with a spear, and using a confidence interval is like fishing with a net
    -   We can throw a spear where we saw a fish but we will probably miss, if we toss a net in that area, we have a good chance of catching the fish
    -   Similarly, if we report a point estimate, we probably will not hit the exact population parameter, but if we report a range of plausible values we have a good shot at capturing the parameter
:::

## Confidence interval for the slope {.midi}

A confidence interval will allow us to make a statement like "*For each additional square foot, the model predicts the sale price of Duke Forest houses to be higher, on average, by `r dollar(slope)`, plus or minus X dollars.*"

. . .

-   Should X be \$10? \$100? \$1000?

-   If we were to take another sample of `r nrow(duke_forest)` would we expect the slope calculated based on that sample to be exactly `r dollar(slope)`? Off by \$10? \$100? \$1000?

-   The answer depends on how variable (from one sample to another sample) the sample statistic (the slope) is

-   We need a way to quantify the variability of the sample statistic

## Quantify the variability of the slope {.midi}

**for estimation**

::: incremental
-   Two approaches:
    1.  Via simulation (what we'll do today)
    2.  Via mathematical models (what we'll do in the next class)
-   **Bootstrapping** to quantify the variability of the slope for the purpose of estimation:
    -   Bootstrap new samples from the original sample
    -   Fit models to each of the samples and estimate the slope
    -   Use features of the distribution of the bootstrapped slopes to construct a confidence interval

## Recap {.smaller}

-   **Population:** Complete set of observations of whatever we are studying, e.g., people, tweets, photographs, etc. (population size = $N$)

-   **Sample:** Subset of the population, ideally random and representative (sample size = $n$)

-   Sample statistic $\ne$ population parameter, but if the sample is good, it can be a good estimate

-   **Statistical inference:** Discipline that concerns itself with the development of procedures, methods, and theorems that allow us to extract meaning and information from data that has been generated by stochastic (random) process

-   We report the estimate with a confidence interval, and the width of this interval depends on the variability of sample statistics from different samples from the population

-   Since we can't continue sampling from the population, we bootstrap from the one sample we have to estimate sampling variability
