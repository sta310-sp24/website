## Examining the relationship

::: midi
-   The [NC Labor and Economic Analysis Division (LEAD)](https://www.nccommerce.com/about-us/divisions-programs/labor-economic-analysis-division) "collects data, conducts research and analysis and publishes reports about the state's economy and labor market. Information and data produced by LEAD help stakeholders make more informed decisions on business recruitment, education and workforce policies and career development, as well as gain a more extensive view of North Carolina's economy."

-   Suppose that an analyst working for LEAD is interested in the relationship between uninsurance and high school graduation rates in NC counties.
:::

. . .

::: question
What type of visualization should the analyst make to examine the relationship between these two variables?

## Data prep

```{r}
#| echo: true

county_2019_nc <- county_2019 |>
  as_tibble() |>
  filter(state == "North Carolina") |>
  select(name, hs_grad, uninsured)

```

## Uninsurance vs. HS graduation rates

```{r nc-uninsured-hsgrad-scatter}
#| code-fold: true

nc_fit <- linear_reg() |>
  set_engine("lm") |>
  fit(uninsured ~ hs_grad, data = county_2019_nc)

tidy(nc_fit)

With `augment()` to add columns for predicted values (`.fitted`), residuals (`.resid`), etc.:

#| echo: true

nc_aug <- augment(nc_fit$fit)
nc_aug
```

## Evaluating the model fit

::: question
How can we evaluate whether the model for predicting uninsurance rate from high school graduation rate for NC counties is a good fit?
:::

# Model evaluation

## Two statistics {.small}

::: incremental
-   **R-squared**, $R^2$ : Percentage of variability in the outcome explained by the regression model (in the context of SLR, the predictor)

    $$
    R^2 = Cor(x,y)^2 = Cor(y, \hat{y})^2
    $$

-   **Root mean square error, RMSE**: A measure of the average error (average difference between observed and predicted values of the outcome)

    $$
    RMSE = \sqrt{\frac{\sum_{i = 1}^n (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2}{n}}
    $$
:::

. . .

::: question
What indicates a good model fit? Higher or lower $R^2$? Higher or lower RMSE?
:::

## $R^2$

::: incremental
-   Ranges between 0 (terrible predictor) and 1 (perfect predictor)

-   Has no units

-   Calculate with `rsq()` using the augmented data:

```{r}
#| echo: true
rsq(nc_aug, truth = uninsured, estimate = .fitted)
```
:::

## Interpreting $R^2$ {.smaller}

```{r}
#| echo: false
nc_fit_rsq <- round(glance(nc_fit)$r.squared * 100, 1)
```

::: poll
🗳️ **Vote on Ed Discussion**

::: midi
::: poll
The $R^2$ of the model for predicting uninsurance rate from high school graduation rate for NC counties is `r nc_fit_rsq`%. Which of the following is the correct interpretation of this value?
:::

-   High school graduation rates correctly predict `r nc_fit_rsq`% of uninsurance rates in NC counties.
-   `r nc_fit_rsq`% of the variability in uninsurance rates in NC counties can be explained by high school graduation rates.
-   `r nc_fit_rsq`% of the variability in high school graduation rates in NC counties can be explained by uninsurance rates.
-   `r nc_fit_rsq`% of the time uninsurance rates in NC counties can be predicted by high school graduation rates.

[Vote - Section 002](https://edstem.org/us/courses/26900/discussion/1738497)

## Alternative approach for $R^2$

Alternatively, use `glance()` to construct a single row summary of the model fit, including $R^2$:

```{r}
#| echo: true

glance(nc_fit)
```

. . .

```{r}
glance(nc_fit)$r.squared
```

## RMSE

::: incremental
-   Ranges between 0 (perfect predictor) and infinity (terrible predictor)

-   Same units as the response variable

-   Calculate with `rmse()` using the augmented data:

    ```{r}
    #| echo: true

    rmse(nc_aug, truth = uninsured, estimate = .fitted)
    ```

-   The value of RMSE is not very meaningful on its own, but it's useful for comparing across models (more on this when we get to regression with multiple predictors)
:::

## Obtaining $R^2$ and RMSE

::: incremental
-   Use `rsq()` and `rmse()`, respectively

    ```{r}
    #| echo: true
    #| eval: false

    rsq(nc_aug, truth = uninsured, estimate = .fitted)
    rmse(nc_aug, truth = uninsured, estimate = .fitted)
    ```

-   First argument: data frame containing `truth` and `estimate` columns

-   Second argument: name of the column containing `truth` (observed outcome)

-   Third argument: name of the column containing `estimate` (predicted outcome)
:::

## Purpose of model evaluation

-   $R^2$ tells us how our model is doing to predict the data we *already have*
-   But generally we are interested in prediction for a new observation, not for one that is already in our sample, i.e. **out-of-sample prediction**
-   We have a couple ways of *simulating* out-of-sample prediction before actually getting new data to evaluate the performance of our models

<!--Ended here in class-->

# Splitting data

## Spending our data

::: incremental
-   There are several steps to create a useful model: parameter estimation, model selection, performance assessment, etc.
-   Doing all of this on the entire data we have available leaves us with no other data to assess our choices
-   We can allocate specific subsets of data for different tasks, as opposed to allocating the largest possible amount to the model parameter estimation only (which is what we've done so far)
:::

## Simulation: data splitting {.smaller}

::: columns
::: {.column width="30%"}
::: nonincremental
-   Take a random sample of 10% of the data and set aside (testing data)
-   Fit a model on the remaining 90% of the data (training data)
-   Use the coefficients from this model to make predictions for the testing data
-   Repeat 10 times

# Bootstrapping

## Bootstrapping our data

::: incremental
-   The idea behind bootstrapping is that if a given observation exists in a sample, there may be more like it in the population
-   With bootstrapping, we simulate resampling from the population by resampling from the sample we observed
-   Bootstrap samples are the sampled *with replacement* from the original sample and same size as the original sample
    -   For example, if our sample consists of the observations {A, B, C}, bootstrap samples could be {A, A, B}, {A, C, A}, {B, C, C}, {A, B, C}, etc.
