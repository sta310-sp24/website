# Model conditions

## Model conditions

1.  **Linearity:** There is a linear relationship between the outcome and predictor variables
2.  **Constant variance:** The variability of the errors is equal for all values of the predictor variable
3.  **Normality:** The errors follow a normal distribution
4.  **Independence:** The errors are independent from each other

## Linearity

-   If the linear model, $\hat{y}_i = \hat{\beta}_0 + \hat{\beta}_1x_i$ adequately describes the relationship between $X$ and $Y$, then the residuals should reflect random (chance) error

-   To assess this, we can look at a plot of the residuals vs. the fitted values

-   **Linearity satisfied** if there is no distinguishable pattern in the residuals plot, i.e. the residuals should be randomly scattered

-   A non-random pattern (e.g. a parabola) suggests a linear model does not adequately describe the relationship between $X$ and $Y$

## Linearity

✅ The residuals vs. fitted values plot should show a random scatter of residuals (no distinguishable pattern or structure)

## Constant variance

-   If the spread of the distribution of $Y$ is equal for all values of $X$then the spread of the residuals should be approximately equal for each value of $X$

-   To assess this, we can look at a plot of the residuals vs. the fitted values

-   **Constant variance satisfied** if the vertical spread of the residuals is approximately equal as you move from left to right (i.e. there is no "fan" pattern)

-   A fan pattern suggests the constant variance assumption is not satisfied and transformation or some other remedy is required (more on this later in the semester)

## Constant variance

✅ The vertical spread of the residuals is relatively constant across the plot

```{r}
#| ref.label: "res-vs-fit"
#| echo: false
```

## Non-constant variance

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}

#| out.width: "100%"

  labs(
    x = "Fitted value", y = "Residual",
    title = "Residuals vs. fitted values"
  ) +
  ylim(-15, 15)
```

## Normality {.midi}

-   The linear model assumes that the distribution of $Y$ is Normal for every value of $X$

-   This is impossible to check in practice, so we will look at the overall distribution of the residuals to assess if the normality assumption is satisfied

-   **Normality satisfied** if a histogram of the residuals is approximately normal

    -   Can also check that the points on a normal QQ-plot falls along a diagonal line

-   Most inferential methods for regression are robust to some departures from normality, so we can proceed with inference if the sample size is sufficiently large, $n > 30$

## Normality

```{r}
#| echo: false

ggplot(df_aug, aes(x = .resid)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 50000, color = "white") +
  labs(
    x = "Residual",
    y = "Count",
    title = "Histogram of residuals"
  )
```

## Check normality using a QQ-plot

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
```{r}
#| code-fold: true
ggplot(df_aug, aes(x = .resid)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 50000, color = "white")  +
  labs(
    x = "Residual",
    y = "Count",
    title = "Histogram of residuals"
  )
```

```         
```
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
```{r}
#| code-fold: true
ggplot(df_aug, aes(sample = .resid)) +
  stat_qq()+
  stat_qq_line() + 
  labs(x = "Theoretical quantile", 
       y = "Observed quantile", 
       title = "Normal QQ-plot of residuals")
```
:::
:::

-   Assess whether residuals lie along the diagonal line of the Quantile-quantile plot (QQ-plot).

-   If so, the residuals are normally distributed.

## Normality

```{r}
#| echo: false

ggplot(df_aug, aes(sample = .resid)) +
  stat_qq()+
  stat_qq_line() + 
  labs(x = "Theoretical quantile", 
       y = "Observed quantile", 
       title = "Normal QQ-plot of residuals")
```

❌ The residuals do not appear to follow a normal distribution, because the points do not lie on the diagonal line, so normality is not satisfied.

✅ The sample size $n = 98 > 30$, so the sample size is large enough to relax this condition and proceed with inference.

## Independence {.midi}

-   We can often check the independence assumption based on the context of the data and how the observations were collected

-   Two common violations of the independence assumption:

    -   **Serial Effect**: If the data were collected over time, plot the residuals in time order to see if there is a pattern (serial correlation)

    -   **Cluster Effect**: If there are subgroups represented in the data that are not accounted for in the model (e.g., type of house), you can color the points in the residual plots by group to see if the model systematically over or under predicts for a particular subgroup

## Independence {.nonincremental}

Recall the description of the data:

> -   Data on houses that were sold in the Duke Forest neighborhood of Durham, NC around November 2020
>
> -   Scraped from Zillow

<br>

✅ Based on the information we have, we can reasonably treat this as a random sample of Duke Forest Houses and assume the error for one house does not tell us anything about the error for another house.

# Model evaluation

## Two statistics {.small}

::: incremental
-   **R-squared**, $R^2$ : Percentage of variability in the outcome explained by the regression model (in the context of SLR, the predictor)

    $$
    R^2 = Cor(x,y)^2 = Cor(y, \hat{y})^2
    $$

-   **Root mean square error, RMSE**: A measure of the average error (average difference between observed and predicted values of the outcome)

    $$
    RMSE = \sqrt{\frac{\sum_{i = 1}^n (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2}{n}}
    $$
:::

. . .

::: question
What indicates a good model fit? Higher or lower $R^2$? Higher or lower RMSE?
:::

## $R^2$

::: incremental
-   Ranges between 0 (terrible predictor) and 1 (perfect predictor)

-   Has no units

-   Calculate with `rsq()` using the augmented data:

```{r}
#| echo: true
rsq(df_aug, truth = price, estimate = .fitted)
```
:::

## Interpreting $R^2$ {.smaller}

```{r}
#| echo: false
df_fit_rsq <- round(glance(df_fit)$r.squared * 100, 1)
```

::: poll
🗳️ **Discussion**

::: midi
::: poll
The $R^2$ of the model for price from area of houses in Duke Forest is `r df_fit_rsq`%. Which of the following is the correct interpretation of this value?
:::

1.  Area correctly predicts `r df_fit_rsq`% of price for houses in Duke Forest.
2.  `r df_fit_rsq`% of the variability in price for houses in Duke Forest can be explained by area.
3.  `r df_fit_rsq`% of the variability in area for houses in Duke Forest can be explained by price
4.  `r df_fit_rsq`% of the time price for houses in Duke Forest can be predicted by area.
:::
:::

## Alternative approach for $R^2$

Alternatively, use `glance()` to construct a single row summary of the model fit, including $R^2$:

```{r}
#| echo: true

glance(df_fit)
```

<br>

. . .

```{r}
glance(df_fit)$r.squared
```

## RMSE

::: incremental
-   Ranges between 0 (perfect predictor) and infinity (terrible predictor)

-   Same units as the response variable

-   Calculate with `rmse()` using the augmented data:

    ```{r}
    #| echo: true

    rmse(df_aug, truth = price, estimate = .fitted)
    ```

-   The value of RMSE is not very meaningful on its own, but it's useful for comparing across models (more on this when we get to regression with multiple predictors)
:::

## Obtaining $R^2$ and RMSE

::: incremental
-   Use `rsq()` and `rmse()`, respectively

    ```{r}
    #| echo: true
    #| eval: false

    rsq(df_aug, truth = price, estimate = .fitted)
    rmse(df_aug, truth = price, estimate = .fitted)
    ```

-   First argument: data frame containing `truth` and `estimate` columns

-   Second argument: name of the column containing `truth` (observed outcome)

-   Third argument: name of the column containing `estimate` (predicted outcome)
