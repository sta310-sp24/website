# Proportional odds models

## Predicting ED wait and treatment times

@ataman2021predicting use ordinal logistic regression to predict patient wait and treatment times in an emergency department (ED). The goal is to identify relevant factors that can be used to inform recommendations for reducing wait and treatment times, thus improving the quality of care in the ED.

**Data**: Daily records for ED arrivals in August 2018 at a public hospital in Izmir, Turkey.\

## Proportional odds model {.midi}

Let $Y$ be an ordinal response variable that takes levels $1, 2, \ldots, J$ with associated probabilities $p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_J$

. . .

The **proportional odds model** can be written as the following:

$$\begin{aligned}&\log\Big(\frac{P(Y 
\leq 1)}{P(Y > 1)}\Big) = \beta_{01} - \beta_1x_1 - \dots -  \beta_px_p \\
& \log\Big(\frac{P(Y\leq 2)}{P(Y > 2)}\Big) = \beta_{02} -\beta_1x_1 - \dots -  \beta_px_p \\
& \dots \\
& \log\Big(\frac{P(Y\leq J-1)}{P(Y > J-1)}\Big) = \beta_{0{J-1}} - \beta_1x_1 - \dots - \beta_px_p\end{aligned}$$

::: question
What does $\beta_{01}$ mean? What does $\beta_1$ mean?
:::

## Proportional odds model {.midi}

Let's consider one portion of the model:

$$
\log\Big(\frac{P(Y\leq k)}{P(Y > k)}\Big) = \beta_{0k} - \beta_1x_1 - \dots -  \beta_px_p
$$

. . .

::: incremental
-   The response variable is $logit(Y\leq k)$, the log-odds of observing an outcome less than or equal to category $k$.

-   $\beta_j > 0$ is associated with increased **log-odds** of being in a **higher** category of $Y$

    -   $e^{\beta_j}$ associated with an increased **odds** of being in a **higher** category of $Y$

-   Effect of one unit increase in $x_j$ the same regardless of which category of $Y$

## Effect of triage level

Consider the full output with the ordinal logistic models for wait and treatment times.

::: question
Use the results from both models to describe the effect of triage level on waiting and treatment times. Note: The baseline category is green.

## Fitting proportional odds models in R

Fit proportional odds models using the `polr` function in the **MASS** package:

```{r}
#| eval: false

proportional_model <- polr(Y ~ x1 + x2 + x3, data = my_data)
```

<!--Do the soccer data example from the people analytics book -->

<!--https://peopleanalytics-regression-book.org/ord-reg.html#ord-walkthrough-->

## Multinomial logistic model {.midi}

Suppose the outcome variable $Y$ is categorical and can take values $1, 2, \ldots, K$ such that

$$
P(Y = 1) = p_1, \ldots , P(Y = K) = p_K  \hspace{5mm} \text{ and } \hspace{5mm}  \sum_{k = 1}^{K} p_k = 1
$$

. . .

Choose baseline category. Let's choose $Y = 1$ . Then

. . .

$$\begin{aligned}&\log\Big(\frac{P(Y = 2)}{P(Y = 1)}\Big) = \beta_{02} - \beta_{12}x_1 - \dots -  \beta_{p2}x_p \\
& \log\Big(\frac{P(Y = 3)}{P(Y =1)}\Big) = \beta_{03} -\beta_{13}x_1 - \dots -  \beta_{p3}x_p \\
& \dots \\
& \log\Big(\frac{P(Y = K)}{P(Y = 1)}\Big) = \beta_{0{K}} - \beta_{1K}x_1 - \dots - \beta_{pK}x_{p}\end{aligned}$$

## Multinomial logistic vs. proportional odds

::: question
How is the proportional odds model similar to the multinomial logistic model? How is it different? What is an advantage of each model? What is a disadvantage?

# Probit regression {.midi}

## Impact of nature documentary on recycling

@ibanez2022impact conducted an experiment to understand the impact of watching a nature documentary on pro-environmental behavior. The researchers randomly assigned the 113 participants to watch an video about architecture in NYC (control) or a video about Yellowstone National Park (treatment). As part of the experiment, participants were asked to dispose of their headphone coverings in a recycle bin available at the end of the experiment.

:::

## Impact of nature documentary on recycling

**Response variable**: Recycle headphone coverings vs. not

**Predictor variables:**

-   Age
-   Gender
-   Student
-   Made donation to environmental organization in previous part of experiment
-   Environmental beliefs measured by the new ecological paradigm scale (NEP)

## Probit regression

Let $Y$ be a binary response variable that takes values 0 or 1, and let $p = P(Y = 1 | x_1, \ldots, x_p)$

$$
probit(p) = \Phi^{-1}(p) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1+ \dots + \beta_px_p
$$

where $\Phi^{-1}$ is the inverse normal distribution function.

<br>

. . .

The outcome is the z-score at which the cumulative probability is equal to $p$

-   e.g. $probit(0.975) = \Phi^{-1}(0.975) = 1.96$

## Interpretation

-   $\hat{\beta}_j$ is the estimated change in z-score for each unit increase in $x_j$, holding all other factors constant.

-   This is a fairly clunky interpretation, so the **(average) marginal effect** of $x_j$ is often interpreted instead

-   The marginal effect of $x_j$ is essentially the change the probability from variable $x_j$

## Probit vs. logistic regression {.midi}

**Pros of probit regression:**

-   Some statisticians like assuming the normal distribution over the logistic distribution.

-   Easier to work with in more advanced settings, such as multivariate and Bayesian modeling

. . .

**Cons of probit regression:**

-   Z-scores are not as straightforward to interpret as the outcomes of a logistic model.

-   We canâ€™t use odds ratios to describe findings.

-   Itâ€™s more mathematically complicated than logistic regression.

-   It does not work well for response variable with 3+ categories

## Fitting probit regression models in R

Fit probit regression models using the `glm` function with `family = binomial(link = probit)`.

<br>

Calculate marginal effects using the `margins` function from the **margins** R package.

```{r}
#| eval: false
margins(my_model, variables = "my_variables")
```

## Ideology vs. issue statements

Let's look at the model using ideology and party ID to explain the number of issue statements by politicians. We will use probit regression for the "hurdle" part of the model - the likelihood a candidate comments on at least one issue (`has_issue_stmt`)

. . .

```{r}
#| echo: false
politics <- read_csv("data/ambiguity.csv") |>
  select(ideology, democrat, totalIssuePages) |>
  drop_na() |>
  mutate(has_issue_stmt = factor(if_else(totalIssuePages > 0, 1, 0)), democrat = as_factor(democrat))
```

```{r}
hurdle_probit <- glm(has_issue_stmt ~ ideology + democrat, 
             data = politics, 
             family = binomial(link = probit))
```

::: aside
See Section 4.11.2 of @roback2021beyond for more detail about the data.
:::

## Hurdle (using probit regression)

```{r}
tidy(hurdle_probit) |>
  kable(digits = 3)

margins(hurdle_probit)
```

::: question
Interpret the effect of `democrat` on commenting on at least one issue.
:::

## Hurdle (using logistic regression)

```{r}
hurdle_logistic <- glm(has_issue_stmt ~ ideology + democrat, 
             data = politics, 
             family = binomial)

tidy(hurdle_logistic) |>
  kable(digits = 3)
```

## Probit vs. logistic models

::: columns

**Probit model**

#| echo: false

::: question
Suppose there is democratic representative with ideology score -2.5. Based on the probit model, what is the probability they will comment on at least one issue? What is the probability based on the logistic model?

# Wrap up GLM for independent observations

## Wrap up {.midi}

-   Covered fitting, interpreting, and drawing conclusions from GLMs

    -   Looked at Poisson, Negative Binomial, and Logistic, Proportional odds, and Probit models in detail

-   Used Pearson and deviance residuals to assess model fit and determine if new variables should be added to the model

-   Addressed issues of overdispersion and zero-inflation

-   Used the properties of the one-parameter exponential family to identify the best link function for any GLM

. . .

Everything we've done thus far as been under the assumption that the observations are *independent*. Looking ahead we will consider models for data with **dependent (correlated) observations**.
