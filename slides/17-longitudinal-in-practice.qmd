## Background and motivation

::: question
Read the abstract and answer the following questions:

1.  What is the primary motivation for the study? What gap in the existing research do the researchers hope to address?
2.  What outcomes are the researchers primarily interested in?
3.  What effects are the researchers primarily interested in?
4.  What is a key conclusion from their study ?

## Data collection 

-   Data are from the Czech Household Panel Survey (CHPS)
-   Data collected annually from 2015 - 2020 between June - October
-   Two-stage stratified sampling used
-   All members of a household were invited to participate
    -   Approached the same households for each wave (year)
-   Respondents filled out a paper questionnaire
-   Large reduction in response between 2018 and 2019 due to new requirements

## Data structure

Multilevel structure with 3 levels

-   **Level Three:** Household

    -   **Level Two:** Individual

        -   **Level One:** Wave

## Response variables

Response variables are based on the "subjective component of integrative quality of life theory."

![Figure 1 in @kudrnavcova2023better](images/17/fig1.PNG){fig-align="center" width="100%"}

Authors state that these factors are important for describing overall quality of life.

## Outcomes of interest {.midi}

We will focus on three of the outcomes:

-   **Life satisfaction (`lfstat_OT`)**: "represents a stable assessment of general feelings about life and indicates a long-term attitude"

    -   Measured as response, ranging from 0 (extremely dissatisfied) to 10 (extremely satisfied), to the question *"All things considered, how satisfied are you with your life as a whole?"*

-   **Wellbeing (`wellbe_OT`)**: "captures a person's emotional state and touches on their mental state"

    -   Measured as average response, ranging from "at no time" to "all of the time", to three items about how often in the last two weeks respondents *"have been cheerful and in good spirits"*, *"have felt calm and relaxed",* and *"have been active and vigorous"*

## Outcomes of interest {.midi}

-   **Happiness (`happy_OT`**): a person's current positive emotional condition

    -   Measured as response, ranging from 0 (extremely unhappy) to 10 (extremely happy), to the question *"Taking all things together, how happy would you say you are?"*

## Sleep variables 

::: question
On page 6, the authors explain how each sleep variable is measured.

-   **sleep duration (`SDweek_OT`)**

-   **quality of sleep (`slequal_OT`)**

-   **social jetlag (`jetlag_OT`)**
:::

```{r}
#| echo: false

library(countdown)
countdown(minutes = 4, margin = 1.25)
```

## Other covariates 

-   **gender**
-   **highest level of education attained** (basic and secondary vocational, secondary with maturita, tertiary education)
-   **household income** (divided into 6 categories)
-   **age**
-   **employment status** (employed, self-employed, unemployed, student, retired, on maternity leave)
-   **number of children below age 5 in the household**
-   **wave** (2018, 2019, 2020)

# Exploratory data analysis 

AE

-   make sure to put in the AE to make certain variables categorical

# Modeling 

## Analysis strategy

::: question
Read the *Statistical analysis strategy* on page 7. Outline the authors' analysis steps.
:::

```{r}
#| echo: false

library(countdown)
countdown(minutes = 6, margin = 1.25)
```

## Considerations for modeling 

::: question
We are going to fit a separate linear mixed model to understand the impact of sleep on each of these quality of life outcomes.

Do you think a linear mixed model is the best choice? Why or why not?
:::

```{r}
#| echo: false

library(countdown)
countdown(minutes = 2, margin = 1.25)
```

# Modeling

AE - fit the model for your group

-   talk about why the code has that weird control line in it

## Testing hypotheses

The authors want to test the following hypotheses:

-   *H1A. Individuals with on average longer sleep duration have higher levels of QoL than individuals with shorter sleep duration.*

-   *H1B. Increases in sleep duration over time are related to higher levels of QoL.*

-   *H2A. Individuals with on average higher sleep quality have higher levels of QoL than individuals with lower sleep quality.*

-   *H2B. Improvements in sleep quality over time are related to higher levels of QoL.*

-   *H3A. Individuals with on average lower social jetlag levels have higher levels of QoL than individuals with higher social jetlag.*

-   *H3B. Decreases in social jetlag over time are related to higher levels of QoL.*

::: question
-   What term(s) in the model can we use to test each hypothesis?

-   What are you conclusions?
