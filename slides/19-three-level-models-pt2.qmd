## Data: Housing prices in Southampton {.midi}

The data includes the price and characteristics for 918 houses sold between 1986 and 1991 in Southampton, England. The data were originally collected from a local real estate agency and were analyzed in @jones1991specifying. The primary variables of interest are

-   **price**: Sales price in thousands of Â£
-   **Age**: Age of the house
-   **Bedrooms**: Number of bedrooms
-   **House Type**: (semi-detached, detached, bungalow, terrace, flat)
-   **Central heating**: Whether house has central heating (0: yes, 1: no)
-   **Garage**: Number of garages (none, single, double)
-   **Districts**: one of 34 districts
-   **Half-years**: Half-year periods beginning the second half of 1986

# Covariance structure of observations

## Questions we want to answer

Let's consider the covariance structure between *observations* at different levels.

. . .

-   What is the covariance structure of houses in the same district sold in different time periods? $(Y_{ij}, Y_{ij'})$

. . .

-   What is the covariance structure of houses in the same district sold in the same time period? $(Y_{ijk}, Y_{ijk'})$
    -   How does this structure differ between Model B and Model C in @jones1991specifying?

## Calculating variance and covariance

Suppose $Y_1 = a_1 X_1 + a_2 X_2 + a_3$ and $Y_2 = b_1 X_1 + b_2 X_2 + b_3$ where $X_1$ and $X_2$ are random variables and $a_i$ and $b_i$ are constants for $i = 1, 2, 3$, then we know from probability theory that: $${\small\begin{aligned}Var(Y_1) & = a^{2}_{1} Var(X_1) + a^{2}_{2} Var(X_2) + 2 a_1 a_2 Cov(X_1,X_2) \\[10pt]
Cov(Y_1,Y_2) & = a_1 b_1 Var(X_1) + a_2 b_2 Var(X_2) + (a_1 b_2 + a_2 b_1) Cov(X_1,X_2)\end{aligned}}$$

We will use these properties to define the covariance structure of the observations in the model.

:::

## Covariance structure under Model B

Let $Y_{ijk}$ be the sales price for the house $k$ in district $i$ sold in time period $j$, and $x_1, \ldots, x_9$ be the house-level covariates. $$Y_{ijk} = \alpha_0 + \sum_{i = 1}^{9}\beta_ix_i + [\tilde{u}_i + u_{ij} + \epsilon_{ijk}]$$ $$\tilde{u}_i \sim N(0, \sigma_{\tilde{u}}^2), \hspace{5mm} u_{ij} \sim N(0, \sigma^2_{u}), \hspace{5mm} \epsilon_{ijk} \sim N(0, \sigma^2)$$

## Variance and covariance derivations

::: question
1.  Use Model B to write the derivation of $Var(Y_{ijk})$, the variance of an individual observation.
2.  Use Model B to write the derivation of $Cov(Y_{ijk}, Y_{ijk'})$, the covariance between houses sold in the same time period that are in the same district.
3.  Write $Cov(\mathbf{Y}_{ij})$, covariance matrix for houses sold in the same time period in the same district
