# Data

## Risk of coronary heart disease {.midi}

This data set is from an ongoing cardiovascular study on residents of the town of Framingham, Massachusetts. We want to examine the relationship between various health characteristics and the risk of having heart disease.

-   `high_risk`:

    -   1: High risk of having heart disease in next 10 years
    -   0: Not high risk of having heart disease in next 10 years

-   `age`: Age at exam time (in years)

-   `education`: 1 = Some High School, 2 = High School or GED, 3 = Some College or Vocational School, 4 = College

-   `currentSmoker`: 0 = nonsmoker, 1 = smoker

## Data prep

```{r}
heart_disease <- read_csv(here::here("slides", "data/framingham.csv")) |>
  select(age, education, TenYearCHD, totChol, currentSmoker) |>
  drop_na() |>
  mutate(
    high_risk = as.factor(TenYearCHD),
    education = as.factor(education),
    currentSmoker = as.factor(currentSmoker)
  )

heart_disease
```

# Estimating coefficients

## Statistical model {.midi}

The form of the statistical model for logistic regression is

$$
\log\Big(\frac{\pi}{1-\pi}\Big) = \beta_0 + \beta_1X_1 + \beta_2X_2 + \dots + \beta_pX_p
$$

where $\pi$ is the probability $Y = 1$.

. . .

Notice there is no error term when writing the statistical model for logistic regression. Why?

-   Recall that the statistical model is the "data-generating" model
-   Each individual observed $Y$ is generated from a Bernoulli distribution, $Bernoulli(\pi)$ (similarly we can think of $n$ observed $Y$'s as generated from a Binomial distribution, $Binomial(n,p)$)
-   Therefore, the randomness is not produced by an error term but rather in the distribution used to generate $Y$

## Estimating coefficients {.midi}

Recall the log likelihood function

$$
\log L = \sum\limits_{i=1}^n[y_i \log(\hat{\pi}_i) + (1 - y_i)\log(1 - \hat{\pi}_i)]
$$

where

$\hat{\pi} = \frac{exp\{\hat{\beta}_0 + \hat{\beta}_1X_1 + \dots + \hat{\beta}_pX_p\}}{1 + exp\{\hat{\beta}_0 + \hat{\beta}_1X_1 + \dots + \hat{\beta}_pX_p\}}$

. . .

-   The coefficients $\hat{\beta}_0, \ldots, \hat{\beta}_p$ are estimated using maximum likelihood estimation

-   Basic idea: Find the values of $\hat{\beta}_0, \ldots, \hat{\beta}_p$ that give the observed data the maximum probability of occurring

# Inference for coefficients

## Modeling risk of coronary heart disease

Using `age` and `education`:

```{r}
risk_fit <- logistic_reg() |>
  set_engine("glm") |>
  fit(high_risk ~ age + education, 
      data = heart_disease, family = "binomial")
```

## Model output {.midi}

```{r}
tidy(risk_fit, conf.int = TRUE) |> 
  kable(format = "markdown", digits = 3)
```

$$
\small{\log\Big(\frac{\hat{\pi}}{1-\hat{\pi}}\Big) = -5.508 + 0.076 ~ \text{age} - 0.245 ~ \text{ed2} - 0.236 ~ \text{ed3} - 0.024 ~ \text{ed4}}
$$

## Inference for coefficients

There are two approaches for testing coefficients in logistic regression

-   **Drop-in-deviance test**. Use to test...

    -   a single coefficient
    -   a categorical predictor with 3+ levels
    -   a group of predictor variables

-   **(Wald) hypothesis test.** Use to test

    -   a single coefficient

## Hypothesis test for $\beta_j$

**Hypotheses:** $H_0: \beta_j = 0 \hspace{2mm} \text{ vs } \hspace{2mm} H_a: \beta_j \neq 0$, given the other variables in the model

. . .

**Test Statistic:** $$z = \frac{\hat{\beta}_j - 0}{SE_{\hat{\beta}_j}}$$

. . .

**P-value:** $P(|Z| > |z|)$, where $Z \sim N(0, 1)$, the Standard Normal distribution

## Confidence interval for $\beta_j$

We can calculate the **C% confidence interval** for $\beta_j$ as the following:

$$
\Large{\hat{\beta}_j \pm z^* SE_{\hat{\beta}_j}}
$$

where $z^*$ is calculated from the $N(0,1)$ distribution

. . .

::: callout-note
This is an interval for the change in the log-odds for every one unit increase in $x_j$
:::

## Interpretation in terms of the odds

The change in **odds** for every one unit increase in $x_j$.

$$
\Large{exp\{\hat{\beta}_j \pm z^* SE_{\hat{\beta}_j}\}}
$$

. . .

**Interpretation:** We are $C\%$ confident that for every one unit increase in $x_j$, the odds multiply by a factor of $exp\{\hat{\beta}_j - z^* SE_{\hat{\beta}_j}\}$ to $exp\{\hat{\beta}_j + z^* SE_{\hat{\beta}_j}\}$, holding all else constant.

## Coefficient for `age` {.midi}

```{r}
#| label: risk-model-age-highlight
#| echo: false

tidy(risk_fit, conf.int = TRUE) |> 
  kable(digits = 3) |>
  row_spec(2, background = "#D9E3E4")
```

. . .

**Hypotheses:**

$$
H_0: \beta_{age} = 0 \hspace{2mm} \text{ vs } \hspace{2mm} H_a: \beta_{age} \neq 0
$$, given education is in the model

## Coefficient for `age` {.midi}

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| ref.label: risk-model-age-highlight
```

**Test statistic:**

$$z = \frac{0.07559 - 0}{0.00554} = 13.64
$$

## Coefficient for `age` {.midi}

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| ref.label: risk-model-age-highlight
```

**P-value:**

$$
P(|Z| > |13.64|) \approx 0
$$

. . .

```{r}
2 * pnorm(13.64,lower.tail = FALSE)
```

## Coefficient for `age` {.midi}

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| ref.label: risk-model-age-highlight
```

**Conclusion:**

The p-value is very small, so we reject $H_0$. The data provide sufficient evidence that age is a statistically significant predictor of whether someone is high risk of having heart disease, after accounting for education.

## CI for `age`

#| echo: false

# Conditions

## The model {.smaller}

Let's predict `high_risk` from age, total cholesterol, and whether the patient is a current smoker:

```{r}
risk_fit <- logistic_reg() |>
  set_engine("glm") |>
  fit(high_risk ~ age + totChol + currentSmoker, 
      data = heart_disease, family = "binomial")

tidy(risk_fit, conf.int = TRUE) |> 
  kable(digits = 3)
```

## Conditions for logistic regression

1.  **Linearity:** The log-odds have a linear relationship with the predictors.

2.  **Randomness:** The data were obtained from a random process

3.  **Independence:** The observations are independent from one another.

## Empirical logit

The **empirical logit** is the log of the observed odds:

$$
\text{logit}(\hat{p}) = \log\Big(\frac{\hat{p}}{1 - \hat{p}}\Big) = \log\Big(\frac{\# \text{Yes}}{\# \text{No}}\Big)
$$

## Calculating empirical logit (categorical predictor)

If the predictor is categorical, we can calculate the empirical logit for each level of the predictor.

```{r}
heart_disease |>
  count(currentSmoker, high_risk) |>
  group_by(currentSmoker) |>
  mutate(prop = n/sum(n)) |>
  filter(high_risk == "1") |>
  mutate(emp_logit = log(prop/(1-prop)))
```

## Calculating empirical logit (quantitative predictor)

1.  Divide the range of the predictor into intervals with approximately equal number of cases. (If you have enough observations, use 5 - 10 intervals.)

2.  Compute the empirical logit for each interval

. . .

You can then calculate the mean value of the predictor in each interval and create a plot of the empirical logit versus the mean value of the predictor in each interval.

## Empirical logit plot in R (quantitative predictor)

Created using `dplyr` and `ggplot` functions.

```{r}
#| echo: false
heart_disease |> 
  mutate(age_bin = cut_interval(age, n = 10)) |>
  group_by(age_bin) |>
  mutate(mean_age = mean(age)) |>
  count(mean_age, high_risk) |>
  mutate(prop = n/sum(n)) |>
  filter(high_risk == "1") |>
  mutate(emp_logit = log(prop/(1-prop))) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = mean_age, y = emp_logit)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) +
  labs(x = "Mean Age", 
       y = "Empirical logit")
```

```{r}

  mutate(age_bin = cut_interval(age, n = 10)) |>
  group_by(age_bin) |>

  count(mean_age, high_risk) |>
  mutate(prop = n/sum(n)) |>
  filter(high_risk == "1") |>
  mutate(emp_logit = log(prop/(1-prop))) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = mean_age, y = emp_logit)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) +
  labs(x = "Mean Age", 
       y = "Empirical logit")
```

## Empirical logit plot in R (quantitative predictor)

Using the `emplogitplot1` function from the **Stat2Data** R package

```{r}
emplogitplot1(high_risk ~ age, 
              data = heart_disease, 
              ngroups = 10)
```

## Empirical logit plot in R (interactions)

Using the `emplogitplot2` function from the **Stat2Data** R package

```{r}
emplogitplot2(high_risk ~ age + currentSmoker, data = heart_disease, 
              ngroups = 10, 
              putlegend = "bottomright")
```

## Checking linearity

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
```{r}
emplogitplot1(high_risk ~ age, 
              data = heart_disease, 
              ngroups = 10)
```
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
```{r}
emplogitplot1(high_risk ~ totChol, 
              data = heart_disease, 
              ngroups = 10)
```
:::
:::

. . .

`r emo::ji("white_check_mark")` The linearity condition is satisfied. There is a linear relationship between the empirical logit and the predictor variables.

## Checking randomness

We can check the randomness condition based on the context of the data and how the observations were collected.

-   Was the sample randomly selected?
-   If the sample was not randomly selected, ask whether there is reason to believe the observations in the sample differ systematically from the population of interest.

. . .

`r emo::ji("white_check_mark")` The randomness condition is satisfied. We do not have reason to believe that the participants in this study differ systematically from adults in the U.S. in regards to health characteristics and risk of heart disease.

## Checking independence

-   We can check the independence condition based on the context of the data and how the observations were collected.
-   Independence is most often violated if the data were collected over time or there is a strong spatial relationship between the observations.

. . .

`r emo::ji("white_check_mark")` The independence condition is satisfied. It is reasonable to conclude that the participants' health characteristics are independent of one another.
