## Topics

-   Review covariance between observations for 3-level models

-   Fit and interpret a multilevel multinomial logistic model

# Covariance between observations

## Model C in Jones (1991)

Recall Model C from @jones1991specifying

## Covariance structure between observations 

::: question
-   Write the variance in price for a single house.
-   Write the covariance between two houses in the same district in the same time period.
-   Write the covariance matrix for houses from the same time period in the same district.

## Covariance structure between observations

::: question
-   Write the covariance between two houses in different time periods in the same district.

-   Write the covariance matrix between houses in different time periods in the same district.
